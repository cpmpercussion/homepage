I"5<p>I’ve been using iPads and iPhones in performances since 2011 and other performers often ask how I connect the iPads to the PA system. The easy answer is “just use the headphone output”, but getting audio cables with a 3.5mm jack that are rugged enough to work on stage can be a bit of a problem.</p>
