<p><strong>Update!</strong></p>

<p>Videos and photos from the event are in <a href="/blog/2013/12/4/theremin-75-videos-and-pictures">this post</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m performing with Ensemble Metatone at a very exciting concert on Friday 25/10 at the ANU School of Art Gallery!</p>

<p>Revenant Media is a special event celebrating a pioneering piece of new-media artwork: Stanslaus Ostoja-Kotkowskiâ€™s Theremin â€˜75.</p>

<p>Four theremins have been reconstructed from the event from original and new parts and Ensemble Metatone and I will use them to perform Prof. Larry Sitskyâ€™s work The Legions of Asmodeus commissioned for the ANUâ€™s â€œComputer and Electronics in the Artsâ€ in 1975.</p>

<p>Following the Legion, the Metatones and I will perform our iPad work MetaLonsdale and Ben Swift will perform a new work for live-coded audiovisuals.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s going to be music and video at the gallery from 6pm-9pm - and itâ€™s free. Be there!</p>

<p>Look out for more photos and videos as the theremins are assembled over the next week!</p>
