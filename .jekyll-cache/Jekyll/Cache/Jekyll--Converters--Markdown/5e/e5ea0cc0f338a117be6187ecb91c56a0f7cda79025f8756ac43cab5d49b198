I"J<p>I have an article in the new issue of PERCUSscene that comes with DRUMscene issue 70! The new magazine is out now so you can grab one from newsagents or <a href="http://www.drumscene.com.au/current-issue">order online</a>.</p>

<p>My article is the first of a percussion technology column that we’re planning to for each issue. This time I’ve written about some different ways to use iPads for reading and practicing scores and charts.</p>

<p>It’s great to be a part of this wonderful magazine!</p>
