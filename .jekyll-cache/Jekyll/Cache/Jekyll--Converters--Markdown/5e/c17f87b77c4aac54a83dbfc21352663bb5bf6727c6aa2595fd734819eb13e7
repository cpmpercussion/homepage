<p>Fun times await!</p>

<p>Ensemble Metatone is heading to Newcastle this weekend for the return of <a href="http://electrofringe.net">Electrofringe</a>! Weâ€™re performing at Hunter St TAFE at 2:10pm this Sunday, October 6th.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s our little blurb from the Electrofringe program:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Combining field recordings and sampled sounds, Ensemble Metatone use custom iPad-based instruments and percussion to create an improvised, sonic immersion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If youâ€™re heading to This Is Not Art, come along and check us out in our first foray outside of Canberra. If youâ€™re super keen you can even go grab <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/metalonsdale/id694075948?mt=8">the MetaLonsdale iPad app from the iTunes store</a> and jam along!</p>

<p>Looks like itâ€™s going to be a really fun day!</p>

<p><strong>Updates!</strong> We had a great time playing and it was awesome to see Electrofringe getting back off the ground! Thanks to the producers and helpers on the day and the Â crowd of listeners and interested passers-by who stopped to check us out!</p>
