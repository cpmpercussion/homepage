I";<p>In May 2014, while I was travelling through Boston, I had the chance to embark on a mini-tour with Maria Finkelmeier as part of <a href="http://www.artweekboston.org">ArtWeek Boston</a>, in between our mallet duo and iPad concerts, we played two nights of experimental music for ice and percussion at the <a href="http://www.frosticebar.com">Frost Bar</a> called Frost Beat!</p>

<p>Along with glass artist <a href="http://www.sarahlovesglass.com">Sarah Cohen</a>, Maria froze up a percussion section of glass chimes, bars and blocks for us to perform on, I brought along some computer music know how and we performed sets of improvised music for the fascinated customers!</p>

<p>Here’s some great images courtesy of Mark Landsberg and a video Maria put together of our concerts!</p>

<p>Since this concert, Maria has put together <a href="http://www.mariafinkelmeier.com/news/2014/9/26/frostbeat-20">ANOTHER Frost Beat night</a> with Amy Garapic. Hopefully I’ll get to come back sometime and make some more ice music!</p>
