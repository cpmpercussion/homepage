<p>Ensemble Evolution’s final concert in Sweden was a commissioned performance of six new works for the tree house suites at <a href="http://www.treehotel.se">Treehotel</a>, a boutique hotel in Harads, Northern Sweden.</p>

<p>This performance was held in the late evening, under the eerie midnight sun to a select group of the hotel staff, guests and locals and was filmed by August Sandström to become a promotional tool for the hotel.</p>

<p>The final part of this project is a CD of the six works, recorded in Piteå and currently waiting to be mastered before release online and on Spotify and iTunes.</p>
