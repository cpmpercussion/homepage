I"c<p>I updated to Leopard last night on my iBook G4 and was thrilled to find that my printer drivers had been deleted. After a furious search I found a press release from HP indicating that Leopard was supposed to delete old printer drivers and use newer built in drivers, supposedly there is a driver for my HP Laserjet 1022n but I couldnâ€™t find it.</p>
