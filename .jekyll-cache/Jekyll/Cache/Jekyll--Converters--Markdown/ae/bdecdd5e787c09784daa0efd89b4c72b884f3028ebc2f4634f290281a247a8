<p>In May 2011, <a href="http://ensemble-evolution.com">Ensemble Evolution</a> went on tour into the south of Sweden to play concerts and give workshops at Oscarshamn Folkh√∂gskolan, V√§sterviks Museum and in Stockholm.</p>

<p>Despite our insistence that it was ‚Äúspring‚Äù, there was a horrible blizzard while we were in Oscarshamn, just when we wanted to move all the equipment!</p>

<p>The tour was great, we met a lot of great students, teachers and locals and experienced another side of Sweden! I had a chance to play a few duos with Anders which the start of a new thing for me!</p>
