I"¹<p>We had a weekend in Melbourne to play two shows - The Esplanade on Friday and Sounds Like Chickenâ€™s final show out at a community centre in Bayswater. In spite (or because of) the reputation of the venue Iâ€™ve been disappointed with our previous shows at the Espy, but I really enjoyed Friday night. A few fans in the crowd knew some words had everybody dancing and the awesome sound guy set up quickly and mixed up a great sound.</p>
