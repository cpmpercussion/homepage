I"¢<p>Heading up to Newcastle tomorrow for Electrofringe and This Is Not Art! The best part is that Iâ€™m putting on the first performance of my new project â€œNorra Vinterâ€ along with my lovely and supportive fiancÃ©e, <a href="http://saturdaysspecimen.blogspot.com">Christina</a>. Norra Vinter is a suite for percussion and iOS reflecting the sights and sounds of life in Northern Sweden, since Iâ€™ve used <a href="http://rjdj.me">RjDJ</a> to develop the iOS component of the performance, Iâ€™ve reworked some of it as an interactive sound experience for the audience to download and take away! So hereâ€™s the link (click this using mobile safari on an iOS device!):</p>
