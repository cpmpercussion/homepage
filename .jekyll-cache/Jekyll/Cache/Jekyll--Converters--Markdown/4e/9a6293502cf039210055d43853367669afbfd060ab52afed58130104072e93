I"©<p>I met with my new friend <a href="http://www.recotana.com/">Recotana</a> (Osamu Funada) in Tokyo the other week. We had a coffee, talked about Arduino and iPhone apps, and walked around Akihabara looking at parts shops. His friend Hide was also there to help.Â  I was lucky to have them showing me around, even though Iâ€™ve been to Akihabara a few times he knew the good shops to visit which Iâ€™d never seen before.</p>
