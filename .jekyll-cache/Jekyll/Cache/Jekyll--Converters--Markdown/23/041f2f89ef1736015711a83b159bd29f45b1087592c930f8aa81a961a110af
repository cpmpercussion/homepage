I"π<p>When I started Ensemble Evolution with Jacob and Maria in Pite√•, we agreed to bring other artists to Pite√• for our Percussion Repertoire Festival and other events. Christina wanted to come to our 2012 festival to present a ragtime xylophone workshop following her Honours project in Australia, but when we decided not to run the festival her session turned into a month of ragtime teaching, performances, composition and recording.</p>
