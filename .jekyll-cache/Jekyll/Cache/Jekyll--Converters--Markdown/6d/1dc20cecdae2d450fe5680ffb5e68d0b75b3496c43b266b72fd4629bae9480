<p>I performed my solo suite from <a href="/nordligvinter">Nordlig Vinter</a> recently at the <a href="http://nime2013.kaist.ac.kr">New Interfaces for Musical Expression Conference</a> at KAIST in Daejeon, Korea. This was a bit of a test for me as Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of revisions to this piece and wanted to use the <a href="http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigpre/">iRig Pre</a> that I bought recently with the Nordlig Vinter iPhone app so I had been doing a bit of preparation in the week before the performance.</p>

<p>The final setup consisted of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>vibraphone</li>
  <li>iPhone with Nordlig Vinter app</li>
  <li>iRig Pre</li>
  <li>short microphone cable</li>
  <li>Behringer C2 microphone</li>
</ul>

<p>(all of which fit into a small stick bag with my mallets)</p>

<p>On stage, I connected the 3.5mm output from the iPhone to the PA system and asked for a pair of microphones to amplify the vibes sound.</p>

<p>The Behringer microphone is one of a pair and probably the cheapest real condenser mic available. The iPhone app uses the signal from this mic to trigger some sounds throughout the piece and also applies a bit of reverb - so itâ€™s not important to have a great mic.</p>

<p>The conference organisers had promised that they would find a vibraphone for me to play but I was still relieved when I had a chance to see that it was a good instrument! Only had to tighten up a few loose bolts to get it working perfectly!</p>

<p>The photos above are of my setup in a practice room and one of me performing courtesy of <a href="http://www.laichihsia.com">Chi-Hsia</a>. Thanks for having me NIME and KAIST!</p>

<p>Overall this was exactly the kind of gig that I had in mind when writing this piece. The vibraphone was borrowed and I could only use velcro straps to attach the mic, preamp, and iPhone. We had a bit of a soundcheck but nothing significant and it was all through an interpreter and there was only a few minutes of setup time before performing. The whole system worked perfectly and (I hope) sounded good!</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a video of me practicing the piece at ANU just before I left for the conferenceâ€¦</p>
