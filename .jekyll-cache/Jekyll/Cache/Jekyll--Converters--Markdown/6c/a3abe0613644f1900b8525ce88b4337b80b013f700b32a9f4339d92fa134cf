<p>Development day at Belconnen Arts Centre.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tested screen materials using speaker stands and pegs. White stretchy material is the winner.</li>
  <li>Lights: cheap flood is ok when reflected against the wall. Good IR and colour. Infrared LED arrays are very uneven but will do the job if aimed at a a shallow angle and diffused with some tracing paper. Need six in two groups of three to cover the screen. Compact fluorescent lamps have no IR.</li>
  <li>Programming - aiming to extend gestureâ€¦ spraying pixels. Need tripods for camera and projector.</li>
  <li>Contact microphones work on screen, very low frequency but still useful for triggering.</li>
</ul>
