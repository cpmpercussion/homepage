I"n<p>Achievement for the day was to gather the necessary items for cooking dinner and having a bathroom. Headed down to one of two big supermarkets in town, I chose the one called “Coop” rather than “ICA”, which is about 30 minutes walk. Had to limit myself to absolute necessities since I had to carry it all home! </p>

<p>I bought:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 bathroom mat</li>
  <li>1 shower curtain</li>
  <li>8 AA batteries</li>
  <li>1 electric jug</li>
  <li>microfiber cleaning cloths</li>
  <li>self soaping dishwashing sponge thing</li>
  <li>Nice teabags</li>
  <li>Nice instant coffee</li>
  <li>Pasta</li>
  <li>2 x instant noodles</li>
  <li>nice pasta sauce</li>
  <li>beef mince (I think it’s beef?)</li>
  <li>frozen vegetables</li>
  <li>salt</li>
  <li>biscuits</li>
  <li>gladwrap</li>
  <li>shampoo</li>
  <li>laundry powder</li>
  <li>tissues</li>
</ul>

<p>and some other stuff I can’t remember.</p>

<p>Then, since I had all the ikea cooking stuff, I should be able to make dinner right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Since I’m in Sweden you have to make dinner the Ikea way, i.e., Step 1 is “Build your saucepans”, so I had to build and wash all the saucepans etc (see photos).</p>

<p>Luckily the Ikea kit came with a colander and a big pasta spoon thing otherwise I would have been in trouble.</p>

<p>Anyway, dinner was successful.</p>

<p>Wondering what other stuff I need? Probably some more varied food, and fruit, etc, but I like keeping it simple. There’s waay more room in the fridge than in the rest of the kitchen and there’s particularly heaps of room in the freezer, so I can keep lots of frozen stuff on hand. </p>

<p>Is a microwave necessary? Particularly for defrosting meat, cooking frozen vegetables, reheating yesterday’s food? I wonder how much one is. I think they have them at Coop as well.</p>

<p>Next thing I really need are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proper sheets—as much as I love my (Christina’s) sleeping bag sheet, I should probably buy regular ones that are easier to wash. Coop has them, but I don’t know the words for different sheet forms (i.e. pillow, fitted, regular..) and it was too hard last night to work it out.</li>
  <li>Dustpan and brush—Coop didn’t seem to have them</li>
  <li>Microfibre mop thing—my whole flat has a lino floor which is still dirty. I made a valient attempt with one of my microfibre cloths, but a mop thing would be waay easier. Need the dustpan first.</li>
</ul>
