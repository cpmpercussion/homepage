<p>I really wanted to put together an album in each year of my Ph.D. , both as a record of work with my accomplished and creative colleagues and to formally recognise the artistic part of my research. This release consists of a live recording of a concert in August 2013 which was the culmination of a series of rehearsals-as-research where we collectively explored two iPad app-instruments through improvised performance.</p>

<p>Press play and listen to what I’ve been working on, here’s the album notes from Bandcamp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ensemble Metatone plays improvised and experimental music using Charles Martin’s iPad-instruments and percussion. In these contemplative works, the group performs on iPads with a vocabulary of touch-gestures inspired by their percussive backgrounds and, conversely, uses acoustic percussion instruments to mimic and augment the apps’ sound-palettes.</p>

<p>The amazing album art was created by the incredible
