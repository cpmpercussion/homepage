<p>Today Lisa received our new infrared LED lights and we set them up on the rack we had already made.</p>

<p>Even without working on aiming and calibrating them too much they already work pretty well!! Much better shadows than with the halogen work lights.</p>

<p>Plus! We got our PS3 camera cases and lenses from peau productions!</p>
