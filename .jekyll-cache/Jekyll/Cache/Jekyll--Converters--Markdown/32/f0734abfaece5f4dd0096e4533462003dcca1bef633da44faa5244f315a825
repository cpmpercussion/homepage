I"Ì<p>I had a really fun time walking around Stockholm with Ensemble Evolution + Anna. We went to two museums - the East Asian museum where they had a terracotta warrior exhibit (pretty super cool), and the Vasa museum which houses a ship that sank in 1698 and was salvaged almost complete in the 50s. Interesting story - they built it and it just sank as soon as it was launched, turns out they didnâ€™t know how to build a ship with two gun decks properly.</p>
