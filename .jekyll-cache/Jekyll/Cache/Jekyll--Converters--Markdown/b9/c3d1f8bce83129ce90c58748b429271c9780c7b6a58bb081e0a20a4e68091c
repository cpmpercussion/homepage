<p>Iâ€™m performing at In2Change - an artistic response to urban renewal in Belconnen at the Belconnen bus interchange, Friday 22nd April, 6pm.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.laichihsia.com/">Lisa Lai</a> and I are playing an ambient duo, â€œMusic for Bus Interchangesâ€, sheâ€™s playing her Hands On Stage instrument and using Supercollider while Iâ€™m playing my field and percussion recordings in Ableton Live with my keyboard controller.</p>
