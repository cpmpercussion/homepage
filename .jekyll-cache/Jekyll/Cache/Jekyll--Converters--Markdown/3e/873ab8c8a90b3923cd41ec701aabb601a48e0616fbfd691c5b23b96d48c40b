I"º<p>A few years ago I was really interested in finding ways to augment the vibraphone with computer music sounds, particularly ways that could fit in my backpack since I was travelling a lot and using other people‚Äôs vibes!</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="http://charlesmartin.com.au/blog/2011/10/28/a-computer-music-system-for-vibraphone.html">this post</a> about an array of small mics and a preamp that I made myself to use with the RjDj app on my iPhone (also my <a href="http://pure.ltu.se/portal/en/studentthesis/mobile-computer-music-for-percussionists(180ad458-3f35-49eb-b483-8245469b0403).html">master‚Äôs thesis</a>). It worked pretty well for the time, but soon after I put it together lots of iPhone music accessories came out that made my home-made monstrosity obsolete. So here‚Äôs my modern ‚Äúno-pickup‚Äù setup:</p>

<p>What‚Äôs in my bag.. for a vibraphone and computer music gig.</p>

<h2 id="mobile-computer-music-setup-for-vibraphone">Mobile Computer Music setup for Vibraphone:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Microphone: <a href="http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/C-2.aspx">Behringer C-2</a>. This mic sucks and is part of a pair, but I don‚Äôt mind leaving it around in my bag and it‚Äôs small and light so it works for this setup. Any other condenser mic would work fine, most would work better.</li>
  <li>Velcro cable ties: I use these to attach everything to the vibraphone securely without marking the frame. I put a bunch of sticky-backed velcro on the mic clip so that I can attach it somewhere underneath the bars.</li>
  <li>Microphone Cable: I have a short mic cable that doesn‚Äôt weigh me down or get tangled.</li>
  <li>Preamp: <a href="http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigpre/">IK Multimedia iRig Pre</a>, one side is an iPhone headphone plug, other side is a mic input. 9V battery, seems to work. I think there‚Äôs a new version that uses the Lightning connector..</li>
  <li>To the PA system: I always bring a 3.5mm stereo jack to 2x 6.5mm mono jack lead and a DI so that I can plug into any PA system. Sound guys never have enough DIs. Never. The <a href="http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/DI20.aspx">Behringer DI20</a> is cheap and light and stereo, works for me.</li>
  <li>Phone: iPhone 5 with an <a href="http://www.otterbox.com/iPhone-5/5S-Reflex-Series-Case/apl7-new-iphone-5,default,pd.html">OtterBox Reflex case</a> - I just leave it on the vibraphone rail. Haven‚Äôt hit it with a mallet‚Ä¶ yet?</li>
  <li>Apps: I usually use my <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/nordlig-vinter/id631988721?mt=8">Nordlig Vinter app</a> which has effects and background sounds for my <a href="http://charlesmartin.com.au/nordlig-vinter/">own pieces</a>, <a href="http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/vocalive/">IK Multimedia‚Äôs Vocalive app</a> could be fun for trying out different effects.</li>
</ul>

<p>(BTW, this setup really only works on a quiet stage, not in a loud band situation.)</p>
