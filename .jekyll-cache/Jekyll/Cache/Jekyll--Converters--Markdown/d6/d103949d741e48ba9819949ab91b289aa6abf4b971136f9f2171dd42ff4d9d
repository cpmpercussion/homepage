I"½<p>When Ensemble Evolution and I were planning our showcase concert for PASIC2013, I suggested that I could put togther an iPad app to use in one of our pieces - an idea that Jake and Maria were super excited to support! We decided that our â€œBirdâ€™s Nestâ€ piece - an improvisation with xylophone, twigs and various percussion accessories recalling the Birdâ€™s Nest treehouse at Treehotel, would work perfectly with an iPad instrument.</p>
