<p>It was a wonderful concert with an audience of students and interested locals treated to a rare screening of the film and the resonant acoustic of the hall filled with the sound of Bill and Ruth‚Äôs collection of gongs and Japanese instruments.</p>

<p>A Sweden-wide search for a film projector capable of running the movie finally ended with a local projectionist dusting off one of their old clunkers for us to use!</p>
