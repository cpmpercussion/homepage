I"á<p>Hereâ€™s a mini-documentary of <a href="http://strikeonstage.posterous.com">Strike on Stage</a>, a percussion and media-art project that I worked on with <a href="http://laichisia.com">Chi-Hsia Lai</a> in 2010.</p>

<p>This was one of my favourite technology projects, we went for a crazy idea, had a lot of fun figuring out new ways to setup lights, screens, cameras, instruments and computers and had great performances.</p>

<p>Luckily I commissioned my friend Pete Butz to document the main performances as well as an interview with Chi-Hsia at I and a rehearsal and to put together this video. It really shows how our system works and what we did in the performances.</p>
