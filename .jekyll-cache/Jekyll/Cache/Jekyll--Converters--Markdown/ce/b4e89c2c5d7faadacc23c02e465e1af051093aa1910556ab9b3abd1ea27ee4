I"…<p>I played a show this evening in Cooma at the youth centre there. Since two bands pulled out, it was a short show with Los Cap, Strong Like Sam and an interesting metalcore two-piece. When we were about to play Scene Queen, Tim unexpectedly presented me with the microphone. Not one to leave such a challenge stand, I ‚Äúsang‚Äù the whole song through. I even embellished my performance with some of Tim‚Äôs special brand of hardcore floor squirming.</p>
