I"à<p>In June I travelled to NIME2018 at Virginia Tech to present some of work from the <a href="https://www.hf.uio.no/ritmo/english/">RITMO centre</a> and <a href="https://www.hf.uio.no/ritmo/english/projects/all/epec/index.html">EPEC project</a> at the University of Oslo. This year, our NIME presentations were focussed on ‚Äústandstill performance‚Äù‚Äîwhere participants have to stand as still as possible to create sound. In previous years, our group had created standstill performances using motion capture in the lab, but our new work was on ways to do this at live events, and even in installations, using the Bela single-board computer.</p>
