I"½<p>So itâ€™s been a <em>rough year</em>. After starting the semester in February with half my <a href="https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300">class</a> of 400 stuck at home in China, we ended up fully-online in March and managed to get the class over the finish line in Juneâ€”phew! In the few short weeks (days?) before starting all over again at the end of July, Iâ€™ll just set down a bit of info for how my online teaching setup works.</p>
