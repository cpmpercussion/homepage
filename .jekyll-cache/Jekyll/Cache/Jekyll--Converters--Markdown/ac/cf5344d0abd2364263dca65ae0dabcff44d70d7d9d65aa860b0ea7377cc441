<p>(Thanks for taking the ones that Iâ€™m in Alec Hunterâ€¦)</p>

<p>It was great to perform works by Nigel Helyer, Stephen Barrass, Benjamin Drury and an improvisation with my PhaseRings iPad app. This was probably the last of my iPad performances at the ANU for while - particularly with these students who are graduating soon - so it was a nice moment!</p>
