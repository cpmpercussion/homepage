<p>The built-in tutorials for Pure Data are really goodâ€¦</p>

<p>Today, someone asked me about how to get started with computer music using Pd, so hereâ€™s the ideas I sent to him for next time somebody asks! Pd, or Pure Data, is a great visual programming environment for music, visuals and graphics, but itâ€™s a bit daunting to get started with it.</p>

<p>The trick to learning a programming language is working through the examples in a good tutorial and then trying to complete some of the exercises. It takes effort and perseverence if youâ€™re new to it, but so does everything worth doing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download <a href="http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended">Pd-Extended</a>.</li>
  <li>Check out the built-in tutorials and help patches. On a Mac, press âŒ˜-B to bring up the Help Browser, click â€œManualsâ€, then â€œStart Hereâ€ for the step-by-step intro. If you want to start hearing some sounds, go to â€œ1.Soundâ€ and start clicking around.</li>
  <li>Look at David Farnellâ€™s tutorial. David Farnell has a great book called â€œ<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/designing-sound">Designing Sound</a>â€ that uses Pd, but the Pd tutorial chapters are <a href="http://aspress.co.uk/ds/pdf/pd_intro.pdf">available for free from the publisher</a>. The<a href="http://obiwannabe.co.uk">authorâ€™s site</a> has lots of Pd resources as well.</li>
  <li>Check out <a href="http://www.pd-tutorial.com">â€œProgramming Electronic Music in Pure Dataâ€</a>. This is another awesome free book on Pd.</li>
  <li>Get stuck and ask questions. If youâ€™re stuck with something, even if itâ€™s dumb, somebody has probably asked a question about it either on the <a href="http://puredata.hurleur.com">Pure Data forums</a> or on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/puredata">Stack Overflow</a>. If youâ€™re stuck, start googling around with what youâ€™re trying to do and if thereâ€™s no obvious answer, post on the forum or on Stack Overflow and somebody will probably rush to your aid.</li>
</ul>
