I"ç<p>Time to catch up on some old blogs!</p>

<p>First up is Theremin ‚Äò75, a concert of music for Theremin, iPad and computer in October. This concert was held to recreate a performance by noted Australian media artist Stanislaus Ostoja-Kotkowski at the Australia ‚Äò75 festival in Canberra. Larry Sitsky‚Äôs 1975 work Legions of Asmodeus was performed on one of Ostoja-Kotkowski‚Äôs restored theremins which is part of the ANU Art Collection and three recreations by Alistair Riddell and Stephen Jones.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs some photos from the rehearsals and performance. The ensemble was Christina Hopgood, Yvonne Lam, Jonathan Griffiths and me!</p>

<p>It was a bit tricky getting the four instruments up and running, theremins typically have small aerials while these instruments had quite large pieces of steel! As a result, our bodies were always in the electric field of the theremin so we had to tune the instruments while on stage. Given that the instruments were on display in a gallery we weren‚Äôt able to look at each other so we used <a href="http://decibel.waapamusic.com/decibelscoreplayer/">Decibel‚Äôs ScorePlayer iPad app</a> to synchronise a scrolling score to perform the work cohesively. The result was loud, crazy, and a lot of fun! Here‚Äôs the video:</p>
