I"˜<p>In January 2015 I ran a four day workshop  in computer music, hardware hacking and new interfaces at the ANU School of Music.</p>

<p>The seven participants learned the basics of electronics assembly, computer music with Pure Data and Arduino programming over four days giving them a suite of skills to draw on for their future projects!</p>

<p>In second half of the workshop, the students were challenged by Alec Hunter to compose an ensemble work to be performed at a finale performance night and we ended up with seven great new works! Hereâ€™s some images from the event and the performance night, and videos from the ANU School of Musicâ€™s YouTube Channel.</p>

<p>The workshop was really successful and Iâ€™m looking forward to running more events like this!</p>

<p>I also had the chance to play back the whole concert set on the Subsequence Radio show on Canberraâ€™s 2XX radio.
