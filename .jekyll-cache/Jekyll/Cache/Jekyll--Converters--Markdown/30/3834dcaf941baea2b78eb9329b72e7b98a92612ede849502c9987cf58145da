<p>I presented a poster at <a href="http://nime2013.kaist.ac.kr">NIME2013</a> at KAIST in Daejeon, Korea last week. This conference has a really vibrant and fun culture of poster and demo sessions - each day thereâ€™s a new set of posters and usually the presenters have a computer running videos of performances or showing the source code for their project and are showing attendees how to use their strange new interfaces!</p>

<p>My poster was about my process of putting together an ultra-portable computer music system for vibraphone using my phone so that I would always have something to perform on tours and at percussion workshops. The culmination of this project is the <a href="/nordligvinter">Nordlig Vinter</a> solo suite that I performed at the conference in an evening concert!</p>

<p>I had a great time showing off my apps to the other researchers and collected a lot of new ideas for my performances!</p>
