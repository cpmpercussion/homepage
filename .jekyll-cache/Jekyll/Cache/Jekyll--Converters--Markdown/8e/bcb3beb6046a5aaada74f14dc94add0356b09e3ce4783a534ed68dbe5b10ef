I"X<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nordlig-vinter/id631988721">The Nordlig Vinter app</a> plays computer generated soundscapes inspired by the landscape of Northern Sweden in winter.</p>

<p>This app is designed to work as the accompaniment for my suite of works for vibraphone and iOS devices, but it can be enjoyed by itself as well!</p>

<p>It’s free! Check it on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nordlig-vinter/id631988721">iTunes store</a>.</p>

<p>The app includes three soundscapes - “Ice Drum”, “Snow Bells” and “Clusters” as well as an adjustable reverb effect that processes audio from the device’s microphone.</p>

<p>Extra Feature: Core MIDI Support! You can use a MIDI accessory connected to your device to play the app’s bell sounds. I often use this app with my malletkat for a super lightweight improvisation setup!</p>

<p>This app was created using the <a href="http://libpd.cc">libpd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/petegoodliffe/PGMidi">PGMidi</a> libraries.</p>
