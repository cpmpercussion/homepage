<p>Concept icons for new and old Metatone apps and our desktop application â€œMetatone Classifierâ€ that can track and interact with a whole ensemble of iPad performers!</p>

<p>Weâ€™re heading to PASIC in Indianapolis in a few weeks to present my seminar on iPads in the percussion ensemble, but before we go, I have a LOT of app development to get all of my work in the store and ready to go! Hereâ€™s a sneak preview of some of the icon art Iâ€™ve been working on to make everything look super classy!</p>

<p>Snow Music, MetaLonsdale and Birds Nest are already in the iTunes store but there are updates on the way with support for this years new iPhones and iPads - Iâ€™ve also got another app on the way â€œPhase Ringsâ€ which weâ€™ve been using extensively in Ensemble Metatone and Iâ€™m really excited to show off at PASIC! Time to get back to workâ€¦</p>
