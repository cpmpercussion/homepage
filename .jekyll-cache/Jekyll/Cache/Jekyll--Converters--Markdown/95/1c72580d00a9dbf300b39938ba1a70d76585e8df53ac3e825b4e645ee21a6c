I"Õ<p>I attended a workshop at Stanford CCRMA about tabletop interfaces which is related to the work that I do in new interfaces using realtime computer vision in performance. 
At the end of an awesome week talking about the future and past of human computer interaction and having fun with processing, chuck and supercollider, we had a little concert. I played two pieces, my new Study for Table and a micro solo version of Strike on Stage, videos below! and photos!</p>
