<p>Cognition Part 2 is being performed this week in Street 2 at the Street Theatre, Canberra. There are shows on Wednesday 15th - Saturday 18th of October at 8:30pm and on Saturday afternoon at 2pm.</p>

<p>The show is a live gallery of four dramatic installations. Iâ€™m performing soundtracks for each installation on percussion and computer. A special feature of my performance is the debut of my computer-augmented vibraphone project, using the Pd environment to analyse sound in real time and control a computer backing.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re also using Pd and Gem for interactive visuals that are incorporated into the performance.</p>

<p>Tickets are $8. Hereâ€™s my setup:</p>
