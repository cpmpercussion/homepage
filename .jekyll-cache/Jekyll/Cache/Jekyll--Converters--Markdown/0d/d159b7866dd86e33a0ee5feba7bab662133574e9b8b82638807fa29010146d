I"√<p>Heading up to Newcastle tomorrow for Electrofringe and This Is Not Art! The best part is that I‚Äôm putting on the first performance of my new project ‚ÄúNorra Vinter‚Äù along with my lovely and supportive fianc√©e, <a href="http://saturdaysspecimen.blogspot.com">Christina</a>. Norra Vinter is a suite for percussion and iOS reflecting the sights and sounds of life in Northern Sweden, since I‚Äôve used <a href="http://rjdj.me">RjDJ</a> to develop the iOS component of the performance, I‚Äôve reworked some of it as an interactive sound experience for the audience to download and take away! So here‚Äôs the link (click this using mobile safari on an iOS device!):</p>
