I"¾<p>I pushed an update out to the Snow Music app on the iTunes store a few weeks ago but forgot to post it!</p>

<p>Long story short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app now has Core MIDI support for external MIDI accessories - the MIDI device will trigger the bell and cymbal sounds!</li>
  <li>The app supports iPhone 5 screen sizes properly</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s still free and still fun to improvise with!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snow-music/id560849530?mt=8">Go check it out!</a></p>

<p>The app still uses <a href="http://libpd.cc">libpd</a> for driving the Pure Data sound engine and now uses <a href="https://github.com/petegoodliffe/PGMidi">PGMidi</a> to help with CoreMIDI.</p>
