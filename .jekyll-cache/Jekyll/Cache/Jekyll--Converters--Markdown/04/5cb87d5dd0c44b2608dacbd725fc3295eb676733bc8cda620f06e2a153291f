<p>I was joined by two master’s students from the UiO Department of Informatics, Benedikte and Henrik who helped to demonstrated MicroJam to the many participants - thanks guys!</p>

<p>It was wonderful to meet so many wonderful teachers, musicians, and developers from around the region and the world, looking forward to getting the app out to them as soon as we can!</p>
