<p>The other day when I went down to ICA to get some food, I saw two girls from Ankars walk in to the shop, each pick up a bottle of Julmust and a block of chocolate and thatâ€™s it, pay and leave.</p>

<p>So I decided to try this magical meal in a bottle.</p>

<p>As it turns out itâ€™s basically cola with fruity and spicy flavors.</p>

<p>The name means Christmas juice and I guess thatâ€™s why Santa is on the bottle.</p>

<p>Warning! Julmust and chocolate is not a balanced diet!!</p>

<p>Review: itâ€™s kind of delicious but smells a bit weird.</p>
