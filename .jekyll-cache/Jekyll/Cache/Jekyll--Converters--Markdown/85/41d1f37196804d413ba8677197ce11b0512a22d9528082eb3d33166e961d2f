I" <p>I recently finished my first prototype for a dedicated computer music system for vibraphone, just in time to use it at 
<a href="http://www.electrofringe.net/">Electrofringe</a> at the end of September and to take with me to Sweden!</p>

<p>The idea is to have a battery powered computer system that can attach to a vibraphone, includes a microphone for processing the vibraphone sound and can output straight to the mixing desk at a gig.</p>

<p>The whole system fits on the end of my vibraphone - compact!</p>

<p>The current setup has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 electret microphones that blutack under the damper pedal in the vibraphone.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Handmade-Electronic-Music-Hardware-Hacking/dp/0415998735/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">battery powered preamp and power supply</a> for the microphones that mixes them down to a mono signal.</li>
  <li>An <a href="http://www.ikmultimedia.com/irig/features/">IK Multimedia iRig</a> dongle to make it easier to connect the microphones and the output to an iPhone</li>
  <li>an iPhone (or iPad) running RjDJ</li>
  <li><a href="http://rjdj.me/music/Charles%20Martin/Norra%20Vinter/399/">my own custom RjDJ scene</a> (programmed in Pd).</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/DI20.aspx">cheap stereo DI box</a> to minimise the work that a sound technician has to do before I can plug into the desk.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, each part of this could be much higher quality: the elecret microphones could be condenser clip on mics, the preamp could a less noisy design with higher gain possibilities, the iRig and iPhone could be a <a href="http://beagleboard.org/hardware-xM">Beagle board computer system</a> running <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~eberdahl/Satellite/">Satellite CCRMA</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve seen a pickup design where the mics are suspended from an elastic band attached with binder clips to the vibes frame, but I havenâ€™t had a chance to experiment with that yet! It might reduce the amount of noise caused by the moving pedal.</p>

<p>But my first goal with this kind of system was for it to exist and work - which it does - and there is every possibility of upgrading it as I find out the best ways to use it.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s some more documentation in the 
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/chuck_notorious/sets/72157627854258763/">Flickr set</a>!</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a video of these pickups in action:</p>

<p>So Iâ€™ve had a few questions about how to make the actual microphones. I donâ€™t have good pictures to go into a total tutorial, but the microphones themselves are cheap <a href="http://www.jaycar.com.au/productView.asp?ID=AM4011&amp;keywords=electret+mics&amp;form=KEYWORD">electret capsules</a>, connected to a long audio cable and then to a simple power supply circuit.</p>

<p>There are good walkthroughs about the power supply circuit in the free version of <a href="http://www.nicolascollins.com/texts/originalhackingmanual.pdf">Hardware Hacking</a> and on this <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/tidmarsh/binmic/">website</a>.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
