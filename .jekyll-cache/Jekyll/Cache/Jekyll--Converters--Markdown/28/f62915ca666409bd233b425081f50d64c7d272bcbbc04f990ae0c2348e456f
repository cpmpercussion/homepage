I"]<p>I had an awesome day with my awesome new friends Maria and Jake! Awesome.</p>

<p>I arrived from a long flight, checked out the school of music at Piteå, bought a Swedish sim card, got my apartment keys, went to an international student dinner AND, Maria had gave me a set of living things that they bought for international students. Yay stuff! Now I can have a glass of water because I HAVE A GLASS.</p>

<p>Tomorrow: Scenes of Piteå.</p>
