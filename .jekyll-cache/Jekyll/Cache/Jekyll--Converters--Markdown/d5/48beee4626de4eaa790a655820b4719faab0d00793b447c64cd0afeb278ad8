<p>This sunday Iâ€™m performing a short concert as part of David Sequeiraâ€™s ENP25 exhibition opening at 
<a href="http://www.everythingnothingprojects.com">Everything Nothing Projects</a> at Lonsdale Street Traders in Braddon.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be performing a special program of music for Malletkat and iPad in the gallery space including Steve Reichâ€™s Electric Counterpoint, my own Nordlig Vinter solo suite, and a new improvised duo for iPad and percussion with Christina Hopgood inspired by the exhibition.</p>

<p>Be prepared for an all-encompassing soundworld paired with a unique perspective on colour and geometry!</p>

<p><strong>Exhibition opening 4-6pm - Sunday 7 July 2013 Performance from 6-6:40pm.</strong></p>

<p>Hereâ€™s some more information about the event:</p>

<p>In David Sequeiraâ€™s work, the application of the circle motif to a range of surfaces blurs the boundaries between individual works of art and the gallery space. Through this process, viewers are encouraged to consider that a response to art is not only a function of what they see, but also the ways in which they see it and engage with it.</p>

<p>In these works, geometry and colour are combined to immerse viewers such that their experience of art is a result of interactions with a number of elements and points of view within the gallery space. These interactions suggest connections between old and new; discarded and prized; beginning and end and past and present. Geometric motif is used to interrupt a singular dominant narrative, thereby encouraging alternative even contradictory readings.</p>

<p>Everything Nothing Performance 6-pm Sunday 7 July (approximately 40 minutes duration)</p>

<p>Charles Martin, specialist in percussion, computer music and interactive media performs Steve Reichâ€™s Electric Counterpoint,and two of his own compositions, Nordlig Vinter, and Metatone No.2 for ipad and percussion. Metatone. No. 2 is an improvisation based on the exhibition ENP 25 David Sequeira.</p>
