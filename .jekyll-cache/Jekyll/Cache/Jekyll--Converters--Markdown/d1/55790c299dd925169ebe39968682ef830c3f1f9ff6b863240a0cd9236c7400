I""<p>Black Hole was a collaborative exhbition and performance nigh at Studio Acusticum in Piteå. Here’s one of Jakob Moe and Lisa Stenberg’s sets.  Uniquely positioned in the orchestra pit of the theatre surrounded by loudspeakers and subwoofers, their sculptural setup emphasised the interaction between the two players and drew attention to the the mess of cables that combined and interconnected their instruments. Sonically, their improvisation were engaging and playful. I liked Jakobs combination of free, ambient sections with rhythmic elements, all based on field recordings.</p>
