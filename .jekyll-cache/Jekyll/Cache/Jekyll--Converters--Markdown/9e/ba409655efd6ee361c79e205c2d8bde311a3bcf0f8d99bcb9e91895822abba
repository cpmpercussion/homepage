<p>My new group <a href="/metatone">Ensemble Metatone</a> performed our first concert recently as part of the Canberra International Music Festival’s free concert series “A Musical Offering”. We played a short version of the improvised work for percussion and iPad that we’ve been rehearsing/researching as well as “Walk on a White Path”, a work I wrote in Sweden.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful concert with a very enthusiastic audience including many subscribers to the Festival. Thanks to Chris Latham, Pro Musica and the CIMF as well as the ANU School of Music for the opportunity to play! (Images courtesy of Peter Hislop - thanks!)</p>
