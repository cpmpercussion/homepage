I"£<p>When I started learning Pure Data (or Pd) a couple of weeks ago, it was difficult to find good tutorials and examples. In the end I used a couple of different tutorials to take my first steps in this language:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7062">Linux Journalâ€™s Managing Audio with Pd</a>. This is a simple absolute beginnerâ€™s tutorial for Pd that explains the basic operations and aims to create a simple delay effect.</li>
  <li><a href="http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/software.html">The Tutorials that come with Pd!</a>Â Pd comes with many (really a lot) of great tutorial patches. If you download Pd, you can go into the installed folder (on Mac OS X right click the Pd application and select â€œShow Package Contentsâ€) and find the folder called â€œdocâ€. Inside here are numbered chapters of an enormous tutorial for Pd! Another way to find this folder is download the source code for Pd.</li>
  <li>Miller Pucketteâ€™s book: <a href="http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/techniques.htm">The Theory and Technique of Electronic Music</a>. This is a textbook written by the creator of Pd which uses the language to illustrate all the examples. Itâ€™s distributed online for free!</li>
  <li>The help patches! When youâ€™re editing a Pd patch, you can right click on object and select â€œHelpâ€. This (usually) opens another patch that explains the function of the object and gives an example. Awesome!</li>
</ul>
