<p>Canberraâ€™s favourite percussion group - DRUMatiX - will be performing a HUGE retrospective concert on Friday 30/11 and Saturday 1/12 at the ANU Arts Centre!</p>

<p>Everybody has to come and watch!!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been involved in DRUMatiX Concerts with Gary France since 2004 and Iâ€™m really excited to be a featured artist in this concert and to present a new arrangement of my piece â€œWalk on a White Pathâ€.</p>

<p>The concert is going to feature some music that is really special to DRUMatiX, like Nigel Westlakeâ€™s â€œKalabashâ€ and our electrified version of Rzewskiâ€™s â€œComing Togetherâ€. Weâ€™re also playing Gary Franceâ€™s new work for percussion orchestra â€œCelebrationâ€ and featuring another (more famous than me) alumni of the group, Bree Van Reyk.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m quivering with excitement about this concert, thereâ€™s going to be an EXCESSIVE amount of instruments, performers and SOUND. I canâ€™t wait.</p>
