I"Í<p><strong>2014-10-02 - added some updates for XCode 6</strong></p>

<p>So Iâ€™ve been working on submitting my Snow Music iOS app to app store, but was frustrated at the final step: archiving and verifying the app.</p>

<p>The problem was that my app uses <a href="http://libpd.cc">libpd</a>, a static library. The app was compiling perfectly well and XCode could install it on my devices, but when archiving the app to verify and upload it for review the verification would fail since:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œSnow Music does not contain a single-bundle application or contains multiple products. Please select another archive, or adjust your scheme to create a single-bundle application.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It turns out that this is just a confusing situation for using static libraries in XCode and not a problem with libpd. I found a straightforward explanation on Aaron Douglasâ€™ site to solve his problem with another static library. The solution was as follows (adapted from Aaronâ€™s instructions):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the libpd project, a subproject of the Appâ€™s project.</li>
  <li>In Build Settings for the libpd project, set â€œSkip Installâ€ to â€œYesâ€. (you need to have selected â€œAllâ€ build settings, not just â€œBasicâ€).</li>
  <li>In Build Settings for the target â€œlibpd-iosâ€, set â€œSkip Installâ€ to â€œYesâ€.</li>
  <li>In Build Phases for the target â€œlibpd-iosâ€ look under Headers and drag all of the files listed under Public and Private to the Project area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, the project has archived, verified and uploaded correctly so now Iâ€™m just waiting for review!</p>
