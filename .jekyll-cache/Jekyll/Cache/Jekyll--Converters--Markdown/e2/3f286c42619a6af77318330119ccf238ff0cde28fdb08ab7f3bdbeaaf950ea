I"~<p>In May 2014, while I was travelling through Boston, I had the chance to embark on a mini-tour with Maria Finkelmeier as part of <a href="http://www.artweekboston.org">ArtWeek Boston</a>, in between our mallet duo and iPad concerts, we played two nights of experimental music for ice and percussion at the <a href="http://www.frosticebar.com">Frost Bar</a> called Frost Beat!</p>
