I"¬<p>Last week the Last Mans and I put on a little run of our <a href="http://lastmantodie.net/">show</a> as part of <a href="http://www.scienceweek.gov.au/">National Science Week</a>.</p>

<p>Most exciting for me was the chance to refine the wearable interface I put together for Hanna.</p>

<p>I upgraded from a regular arduino, xbee shield and 6 AA batteries to an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardFio">Arduino Fio</a> and a LiPo battery. The Arduino Fio is super cool to use, it has a built-in xBee socket, and a charging circuit for the lithium polymer battery. The old rig used to be strapped on to Hannaâ€™s back but we could stick the new setup to her arm with velcro so it was much easier to take on and off.</p>

<p>Now what else can I do with the Fio?</p>
