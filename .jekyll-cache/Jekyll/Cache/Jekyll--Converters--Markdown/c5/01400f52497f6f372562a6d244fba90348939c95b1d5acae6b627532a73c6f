<p>We brought along a set of rapidly-prototyped handmade synthesisers, my iPad musical instrument PhaseRings and some new experimental music apps for Android and iOS.</p>

<p>Lots of great interest and conversation from concertgoers young and old as well as a few quizzical looks about our “weird sounds”!</p>
