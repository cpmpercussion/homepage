### lessons in improvisation and jazz vibraphone/marimba 

From July 2012 I will be offering lessons in improvisation and jazz
interpretation on vibraphone and marimba. Lessons will be in my home
studio where the student and I will have enough space for collaborative
music making and exploration.

In these lessons I want to help students explore their own musicality
and give them tools to encourage them in improvisation, performance in
jazz styles, song writing and composition. Students in high school and
university are welcome as are adult learners. Students should probably
understand the basics of keyboard percussion and need to bring a set of
four marimba or vibraphone mallets.

A typical lesson might have some of these activities:

-   free form improvisation in a particular scale or key
-   creating and recording a simple piece by putting together riffs or
    chord progressions
-   looking at a jazz standard and working on accompanying and soloing
    from a written chart

Of course, I'm happy to help students with any aspect of their playing.

instruments: Musser M55 Vibraphone, MalletKat (4 octave) location:
Charles' home studio in Ainslie, ACT price: $80 per 1 hour lesson.

### Recommended Mallets

If you don't have any mallets, here's a few models that are good for
starting out.

## Drumset

Most of my students learn drumset, snare drum and mallet percussion. In
drumset, my teaching style emphasises études, ensemble performance,
reading and improvisation. Students perform carefully composed études
that allow us to play together or for students to play in small groups.
The études are supported by rigorous technical training in rudiments and
individual drumset grooves to develop students\' coordination, stick
control, touch and tone.

The result of this training are students who are ready to read charts
and perform in school stage bands as well as start their own bands and
ensembles based on song writing and improvisation.
