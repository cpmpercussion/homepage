<h3>lessons in improvisation and jazz vibraphone/marimba<br>
</h3>
<p>From July 2012 I will be offering lessons in improvisation and jazz interpretation on vibraphone and marimba. Lessons will be in my home studio where the student and I will have enough space for collaborative music making and exploration.</p>
<p>In these lessons I want to help students explore their own musicality and give them tools to encourage them in improvisation, performance in jazz styles, song writing and composition. Students in high school and university are welcome as are adult learners. Students should probably understand the basics of keyboard percussion and need to bring a set of four marimba or vibraphone mallets.</p>
<p>A typical lesson might have some of these activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>free form improvisation in a particular scale or key</li>
<li>creating and recording a simple piece by putting together riffs or chord progressions</li>
<li>looking at a jazz standard and working on accompanying and soloing from a written chart</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I’m happy to help students with any aspect of their playing.</p>
<p>instruments: Musser M55 Vibraphone, MalletKat (4 octave)
location: Charles’ home studio in Ainslie, A.C.T.
price: $80 per 1 hour lesson.

<h2 id="drumset">Drumset</h2>
<p>Most of my students learn drumset, snare drum and mallet percussion. In drumset, my teaching style emphasises études, ensemble performance, reading and improvisation. Students perform carefully composed études that allow us to play together or for students to play in small groups. The études are supported by rigorous technical training in rudiments and individual drumset grooves to develop students' coordination, stick control, touch and tone.</p>
<p>The result of this training are students who are ready to read charts and perform in school stage bands as well as start their own bands and ensembles based on song writing and improvisation.</p>
