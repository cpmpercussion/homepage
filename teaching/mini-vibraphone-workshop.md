# Mini-Vibraphone Workshop

![](/squarespace_images/static_500baf96c4aa540325612fa5_t_53aa8961e4b02987deb7a49c_1403685228920_2012-02-21+12-13-06+iPad+Score+reading+Practice+Session.jpg_)

This holidays I'm running a Mini Vibraphone Workshop for high school
and uni students! Lots of us have a big marimba focus but rarely develop
our vibes playing - so here's a good chance! In a three hour session
we'll cover some of the fundamentals of vibraphone playing -
techniques, standard repertoire, and jazz improvisation.

After the workshop, you should be better equipped to approach vibes
parts or solos you\'d like to work on and be ready to start playing some
jazz as well!

-   **Date: Thursday 17th July 9am-1pm**
-   **Location: ANU School of Music, Room 1.28**
-   **Cost: \$50 (payment on the day EFTPOS/Credit or cash accepted)**

Bring some vibes mallets (or the closest you have) and any vibraphone
music or parts you\'re working on. We\'ll have lots of vibraphones set
up so everyone will get plenty of chances to play and try out new ideas!

## Why am I putting this on? {#whyamiputtingthison}

Vibraphone has always been my favourite keyboard instrument, but it
doesn\'t have the same status as marimba for solos and isn\'t played as
much as xylophone or glockenspiel in ensembles. I\'ve spent years
working on vibraphone playing, finding repertoire for my recitals and
other concerts and improvising my own parts so that I can play vibes in
ensembles! I really want to share my passion for this great instrument!

## Vibraphone Mallets {#vibraphonemallets}

Everybody at the workshop needs to have a set of their own mallets.
Vibes mallets are typically more rubbery than marimba mallets with a
hard-wearing acrylic yarn and rattan shafts. If you need to buy some, I
would recommend the following:

-   [Innovative Fundamental
    5.5](http://optimumpercussion.com.au/innovative-perc-medium-vibes-mallets.html)
    (a good first vibes mallet)
-   [Innovative Anders Åstrand
    AÅ25](http://optimumpercussion.com.au/innovative-anders-anstrand-medium-vibes.html)
    (my usual choice - heavy compared to other mallets)
-   [Mike Balter Basics BB5 Vibe
    Mallet](http://optimumpercussion.com.au/mike-balter-bb5-basics-vibe-mallets-med.html)
    (these are inexpensive, but have birch shafts)

If you\'re buying a set - spring for two pairs of the same kind so you
can play with four! The easiest way to get these is through Optimum
Percussion in Sydney:
