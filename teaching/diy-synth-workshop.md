This workshop is a crash-course in creating sound-making electronics!
We're going to use some inexpensive parts to make some insane, noisy
synthesisers and think about some ways to use them in performances.

-   **Date: Friday 10th July 2015 10am-5pm**
-   **Location: Big Band Room, Peter Karmel Building, ANU School of
    Music**
-   **Cost: \$100 (payment via PayPal or credit/debit card, cash or card
    accepted on the day)**
-   **Includes: Tuition and all parts and materials to make a crazy DIY
    synth!**

We're going to repurpose two common integrated circuits from the
foundations of computing as sound-making oscillators and you\'ll learn
how to control their pitch and volume with knobs and light-sensors and
make them play nice with other gear like effects pedals and amplifiers.
Each part can be made into *multiple* oscillator voices leading to some
highly unusual sound possibilities!

All the materials to create a synthesiser from scratch are provided
including cardboard and plastic containers to make custom enclosures!
You can keep your hackable creations for your next musical experiment!

## Bookings Essential! {#bookingsessential}

This workshop is limited to **10 places** and it won\'t go ahead until I
have five confirmed!

Register using the online form below, and I\'ll send you a Paypal
invoice for the workshop (payment by credit/debit or Paypal account). No
booking is final until payment is made!
