In our 30 or 60 minute lessons, I can work with you to start out playing
drumset, mallet percussion, electronic instruments, to work on your
sight reading, improvisation, record your own music or to help you
prepare repertoire for recitals or auditions.

**Possible Topics for Lessons:**

-   Beginning Drumset
-   Beginning Mallet Percussion
-   Sight Reading
-   Vibraphone repertoire and technique
-   4-Mallet Marimba Repertoire
-   Jazz Vibraphone and Marimba
-   Electronic Percussion
-   Free improvisation
-   Composing for percussion
-   Recording

Lessons take place in the School of Music's specialised percussion
studios where we will have access to drumsets, marimbas, vibraphones,
xylophones and orchestral percussion instruments as well as a world
class selection of electronic percussion including malletKats, V-Drums
and recording equipment. Our lessons can be recorded to keep track of
our work together and I\'m happy to help you make music on whichever
percussion and electronic instruments you would like to pursue!

typically weekly.
