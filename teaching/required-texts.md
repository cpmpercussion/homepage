# Mallets:

Beginning students will need:

-   [Vic Firth 5A
    drumsticks](http://www.bettermusic.com.au/vic-firth-5a-wood-tip-drumsticks)
    (\$17)
-   [Dovey Percussion](http://www.doveypercussion.com.au) Medium Marimba
    Mallets (\$58)
-   [Dovey Percussion](http://www.doveypercussion.com.au) Medium Rubber
    Mallets (\$19)
-   Stick Bag (\$25)

I sell Dovey Percussion mallet directly to students - Ross Dovey makes
these great mallets by hand in Queensland and offers them at much lower
prices than overseas manufacturers to get more mallets in the hands of
young percussionists. I have the whole range at the moment so ask to try
them out sometime!

# Music books: {#musicbooks}

These are the standard texts I use with my percussion students.
Beginning students can start their first few lessons with some of my
handouts, but should buy one or two books over their first term of
lessons.
