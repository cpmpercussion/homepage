## About MicroJam

MicroJam is a mobile app for sharing tiny touch-screen performances.
Mobile applications that streamline creativity and social interaction
have enabled a very broad audience to develop their own creative
practices. While these apps have been very successful in visual arts
(particularly photography), the idea of social music-making has not had
such a broad impact. MicroJam includes several novel performance
concepts intended to engage the casual music maker and inspired by
current trends in social creativity support tools. Touch-screen
performances are limited to 5-seconds, instrument settings are posed as
sonic "filters", and past performances are arranged as a timeline with
replies and layers. These features of MicroJam encourage users not only
to perform music more frequently, but to engage with others in impromptu
ensemble music making.

MicroJam is available on [Github](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/microjam) and archived at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/70703690). You can cite MicroJam

## How it works

Microjam has a social-media style feed. You can tap other performances to play,
or tap the reply button to record a new layer.

The RoboJam function automatically creates a new performance on top of an existing jam.
