## About MicroJam

![]({% link assets/projects/microjam/microjam-outdoor-music-making.jpg %})

MicroJam is a mobile app for sharing tiny touch-screen performances.
Mobile applications that streamline creativity and social interaction
have enabled a very broad audience to develop their own creative
practices. While these apps have been very successful in visual arts
(particularly photography), the idea of social music-making has not had
such a broad impact. MicroJam includes several novel performance
concepts intended to engage the casual music maker and inspired by
current trends in social creativity support tools. Touch-screen
performances are limited to 5-seconds, instrument settings are posed as
sonic \"filters\", and past performances are arranged as a timeline with
replies and layers. These features of MicroJam encourage users not only
to perform music more frequently, but to engage with others in impromptu
ensemble music making.


## How it works
