<p>I offer individual music lessons at the ANU School of Music as an ANU Performance Teaching Fellow (<a href="http://music.anu.edu.au/people/charles-martin">here's my profile on the ANU Website</a>). These lessons are open to all ANU students as well as primary and high-school students.</p>

<p>In our 30 or 60 minute lessons, I can work with you to start out playing drumset, mallet percussion, electronic instruments, to work on your sight reading, improvisation, record your own music or to help you prepare repertoire for recitals or auditions.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Topics for Lessons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Beginning Drumset</li>
<li>Beginning Mallet Percussion</li>
<li>Sight Reading</li>
<li>Vibraphone repertoire and technique</li>
<li>4-Mallet Marimba Repertoire</li>
<li>Jazz Vibraphone and Marimba</li>
<li>Electronic Percussion</li>
<li>Free improvisation</li>
<li>Composing for percussion</li>
<li>Recording</li>
</ul>

<p>Lessons take place in the School of Music's specialised percussion studios where we will have access to drumsets, marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones and orchestral percussion instruments as well as a world class selection of electronic percussion including malletKats, V-Drums and recording equipment. Our lessons can be recorded to keep track of our work together and I'm happy to help you make music on whichever percussion and electronic instruments you would like to pursue!</p>

<p>Lessons cost <strong>$45</strong> per 30 minutes and <strong>$90</strong> per hour. Payment is in advance, once per term, and is made directly to me through credit card, PayPal or cash. In our first meeting we will decide on a number of lessons to take over the next term and arrange a timetable. Lessons are typically weekly.</p>

<h2 id="conditionsforindividuallessons">Conditions for individual lessons</h2>

<p>Cancellation or rescheduling of lessons is possible with 24 hours notice. If you know you're going to miss a lesson, please get in touch as soon as possible to make an alternative arrangement. Missed lessons with no notice are forfeited. Payment in advance is required before lessons start for each term.</p>
