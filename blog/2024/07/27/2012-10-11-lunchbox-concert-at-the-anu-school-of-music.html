<p>I played a fun concert today with Gary France at the ANU School of Music. We played Maria Schnieder’s “The Pretty Road” as a duo to open a Lunchbox Concert with lots of his students. It was really great to see that there are great things still happening over at the School of Music and lots of cool things to come!</p>
