<p>A <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3650?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US#">good tip from Apple Support</a> on how to export the sound of auxiliary channel strips in Logic when doing an “export all tracks”</p>

<p>The trick is to select the channel strips then go “Option -&gt; Create Arrange Tracks for Selected Channel Strips”, then to put short empty regions in each track.</p>
