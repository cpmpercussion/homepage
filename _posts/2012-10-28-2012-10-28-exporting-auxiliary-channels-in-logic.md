A [good tip from Apple Support](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3650?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US#) on how to export the sound of auxiliary channel strips in Logic when doing an "export all tracks"

The trick is to select the channel strips then go "Option -> Create Arrange Tracks for Selected Channel Strips", then to put short empty regions in each track.
