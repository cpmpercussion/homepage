Today I'm announcing a [debut, self-titled album, from Ensemble Metatone](http://charlesmartin.bandcamp.com/album/ensemble-metatone), my group dedicated to creating improvised and experimental music using iPad apps and percussion!

I really wanted to put together an album in each year of my Ph.D. , both as a record of work with my accomplished and creative colleagues and to formally recognise the artistic part of my research. This release consists of a live recording of a concert in August 2013 which was the culmination of a series of rehearsals-as-research where we collectively explored two iPad app-instruments through improvised performance.

Press play and listen to what I've been working on, here's the album notes from Bandcamp:

>Ensemble Metatone plays improvised and experimental music using Charles Martin's iPad-instruments and percussion. In these contemplative works, the group performs on iPads with a vocabulary of touch-gestures inspired by their percussive backgrounds and, conversely, uses acoustic percussion instruments to mimic and augment the apps' sound-palettes.

The amazing album art was created by the incredible
