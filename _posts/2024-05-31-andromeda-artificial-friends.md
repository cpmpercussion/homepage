Andromeda is Coming, the exploratory music project of (me!) Charles Martin and Alec Hunter recently developed a concert of new works all featuring research into intelligent (or AI-enabled) musical instruments. Incorporating new perspectives in our work, we invited two members of my ANU SMCClab research lab, Yichen Wang and Sandy Ma to join us for a 60-minute concert of live audio-visual performances.

Our concert took place on Wednesday 29 May 2024 at the Big Band Room, ANU School of Music. The whole concert can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/86yEZquWsPs) and below.

It was an important moment for our lab to put together a whole concert of music, not just the typical 10-minute conference demo, and to invite the community to see it. As always, it was a privilege to share the stage with Alec Hunter, Yichen Wang, and Sandy Ma. I want to thank Craig Greening for helping with sound and Eric Byler for taking photos and video!

**Update:** the [College of Systems and Society has posted an article about our work at this concert!](https://systems.anu.edu.au/news/whats-sound-duet-humans-and-ai-concert)

A 60-minute performance of new music for new AI musical instruments featuring Alec Hunter, Charles Martin, Yichen Wang and Sandy Ma.

Andromeda is Coming is the improvised music project of Charles Martin and Alec Hunter dedicated to exploring new sounds and music making technologies in long-form musical performances.

For this performance, Andromeda adopt artificial intelligence and augmented reality musical instruments from the ANU Sound, Music and Creative Computing Lab. These include Charles Martin’s IMPSY system for building intelligent musical instruments and Yichen Wang’s “Cubing Sound” augmented reality musical instrument. These new musical instruments will be reflected by real-time interactive visualisation.
We ask what new sounds and new music might be created with these new technologies, and what AI and virtual musical performances will look like?
