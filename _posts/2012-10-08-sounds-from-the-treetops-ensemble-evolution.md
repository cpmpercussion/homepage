![The cover of Ensemble Evolution's forthcoming album!]({{ site.baseurl }}/squarespace_images/2012-10-08-Treetops.jpg) The cover of Ensemble Evolution's forthcoming album! 

Ensemble Evolution's final concert in Sweden was a commissioned performance of six new works for the tree house suites at [Treehotel](http://www.treehotel.se), a boutique hotel in Harads, Northern Sweden.

This performance was held in the late evening, under the eerie midnight sun to a select group of the hotel staff, guests and locals and was filmed by August Sandström to become a promotional tool for the hotel.

The final part of this project is a CD of the six works, recorded in Piteå and currently waiting to be mastered before release online and on Spotify and iTunes.
