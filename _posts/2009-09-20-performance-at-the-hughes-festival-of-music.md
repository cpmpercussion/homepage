On Friday, I performed with Chi-Hsia Lai and Veronica WalshawÂ at the Hughes Festival of Music - in a bakery! The programme was:

* Duet for Vibraphone and Computer - Charles Martin
* Hands on Stage ^2 - Chi-Hsia Lai and Charles Martin
* Libertango - Eric Sammut
* Djilile - Peter Sculthorpe
* Electric Counterpoint - Steve Reich
* Descendo a Serra
* Tropical Feeling - Nebojsa Zivkovic
* Ghanaian Bells - Gary France

A bit tricky to fit a marimba, malletkat, computer vision surface and other percussion instruments into the venue but we did it!
