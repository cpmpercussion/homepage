Ensemble Evolution's new album "Sounds from the Treetops" has just gone live on Bandcamp! The album features music by all three of us, including two tracks (Planks and Mirror Cube) by me!


I'm super excited - this album was recorded in Sweden in just two days after a hectic three weeks writing and rehearsing the music and premiering the works on our tour to the Treehotel at Harads, Northern Sweden. After recording it it took us four months of on and off work to choose the takes and for me to do some preliminary mixing before sending it to Sebastian LÃ¶nberg, our mastering engineer and now finally it's out!


It's free to stream online, so press play below and if you like what you hear, consider buying a digital copy and helping to support our music making!
