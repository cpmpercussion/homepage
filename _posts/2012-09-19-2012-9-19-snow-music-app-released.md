The 
Snow Music app I developed with 
Ensemble Evolution as part of my research in Piteå, is now available for free on the 
[iTunes store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/snow-music/id560849530?ls=1&mt=8)!


Download it and check it out! Leave me a note in the comments/twitter/facebook if you like it.


The app was developed using field recordings from Piteå with Pure Data and libpd, there's more information about it in my 
[thesis](http://charlesmartin.com.au/2012/6/26/mobile-computer-music-for-percussionists.html) or this 
[paper](http://charlesmartin.com.au/2012/7/17/paper-in-acmc-2012.html).


Here's a short video of Ensemble Evolution performing with the app:
