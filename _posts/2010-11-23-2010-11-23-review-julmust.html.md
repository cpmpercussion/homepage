The other day when I went down to ICA to get some food, I saw two girls from Ankars walk in to the shop, each pick up a bottle of Julmust and a block of chocolate and that's it, pay and leave.

 So I decided to try this magical meal in a bottle. 
 As it turns out it's basically cola with fruity and spicy flavors. The name means Christmas juice and I guess that's why Santa is on the bottle. 
 Warning! Julmust and chocolate is not a balanced diet!! 
 Review: it's kind of delicious but smells a bit weird.
