`Charles:` I wanted to take Strike on Stage with me overseas, so Lisa and I each made a smaller version of the screen. When I went to the US and Canada recently, I brought my setup with me and performed a solo version of Strike on Stage at Stanford's CCRMA, a computer music research institution.

Here's some photos of the setup and software:
