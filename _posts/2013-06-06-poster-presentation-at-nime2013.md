I presented a poster at [NIME2013](http://nime2013.kaist.ac.kr) at KAIST in Daejeon, Korea last week. This conference has a really vibrant and fun culture of poster and demo sessions - each day there's a new set of posters and usually the presenters have a computer running videos of performances or showing the source code for their project and are showing attendees how to use their strange new interfaces!

My poster was about my process of putting together an ultra-portable computer music system for vibraphone using my phone so that I would always have something to perform on tours and at percussion workshops. The culmination of this project is the [Nordlig Vinter](/nordligvinter) solo suite that I performed at the conference in an evening concert!

I had a great time showing off my apps to the other researchers and collected a lot of new ideas for my performances!
