I'm performing at In2Change - an artistic response to urban renewal in Belconnen at the Belconnen bus interchange, Friday 22nd April, 6pm.

[Lisa Lai](http://www.laichihsia.com/) and I are playing an ambient duo, "Music for Bus Interchanges", she's playing her Hands On Stage instrument and using Supercollider while I'm playing my field and percussion recordings in Ableton Live with my keyboard controller.
