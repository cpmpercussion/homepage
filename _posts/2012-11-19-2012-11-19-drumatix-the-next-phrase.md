Canberra's favourite percussion group - DRUMatiX - will be performing a HUGE retrospective concert on Friday 30/11 and Saturday 1/12 at the ANU Arts Centre!


Everybody has to come and watch!!


I've been involved in DRUMatiX Concerts with Gary France since 2004 and I'm really excited to be a featured artist in this concert and to present a new arrangement of my piece 
"Walk on a White Path".


The concert is going to feature some music that is really special to DRUMatiX, like Nigel Westlake's 
"Kalabash" and our electrified version of Rzewski's 
"Coming Together". We're also playing Gary France's new work for percussion orchestra 
"Celebration" and featuring another (more famous than me) alumni of the group, Bree Van Reyk.


I'm quivering with excitement about this concert, there's going to be an EXCESSIVE amount of instruments, performers and SOUND. I can't wait.
