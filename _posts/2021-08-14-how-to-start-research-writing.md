Now's the time of year that I get started with a new crop of Honours, Master and project students at the [ANU School of Computing](https://cs.anu.edu.au) and at the [UiO Department of Informatics](https://ifi.uio.no).

All of my CS project students produce a report or thesis for their assessment. This will be the most important part of the assessment for your project and you'll probably put quite a bit of effort into writing it.

In this post I'll set down some of the most important 

## Structure

## Formatting

## Length

## Introduction:

Your introduction needs to explain:

- What is your problem?
- Why is it interesting?
- What have you done to solve it?  (What are your aims/research questions?)
- What were the results?

Basically a mini version of the whole thesis! 

Need to focus on the problem, and the "why" of your project. 

Important to set up the aims and research questions of the project clearly and to briefly state the main results so the reader knows what to expect and so that you can address them in more detail in the conclusion.

## Conclusion:

Similar to your introduction!

This time, focus on what you accomplished, addressing the aims/RQs with the findings.

Also need to put your thesis into context a bit — this is where “future work” fits, but also writing about how your work could be applied and what it MEANS in the world outside of this project.

## Both parts

- Both intro and conclusion need to have the basic information of your thesis
- Intro is more focussed on setting up the problem, the why, and you aims
- Conclusion more focussed on address the aims using evidence from your findings.
- Conclusion also puts work into context.
