In November 2013, I visited Boston to meet up with my group from Sweden, Ensemble Evolution. We were preparing for our debut showcase at PASIC2013 by playing a few concerts at the Arnold Arboretum and around Boston! We also had the chance to visit a few of our supporters, Neil Grover of Grover Pro Percussion and Keith Aleo at Zildjian. It was awesome to visit the Grover and Zildjian factories and use some of their exciting new instruments in our performances!
