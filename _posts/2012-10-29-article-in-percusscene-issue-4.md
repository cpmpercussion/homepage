I have an article in the new issue of PERCUSscene that comes with DRUMscene issue 70! The new magazine is out now so you can grab one from newsagents or [order online](http://www.drumscene.com.au/current-issue).

My article is the first of a percussion technology column that we're planning to for each issue. This time I've written about some different ways to use iPads for reading and practicing scores and charts.

It's great to be a part of this wonderful magazine!
