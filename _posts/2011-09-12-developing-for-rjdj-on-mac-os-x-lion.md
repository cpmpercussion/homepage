update the developer tools from [rjdj.me](http://rjdj.me) have been updated for lion now.

So I got back to developing some RjDJ with my new MacBook Pro which (naturally) runs lion. But! The development tools donâ€™t work anymore.

To run the rjzserver from the command line, you need to install wxpython from their website

    http://www.wxpython.org/download.php

Then install mako templates:

    sudo easy_install mako

Now you need to run this line instructs Python to run in 32 bit mode.

    defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Prefer-32-Bit -bool yes

And then you can run rjzserver:

    python rjzserver.py
