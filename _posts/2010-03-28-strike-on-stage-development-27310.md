Development day at Belconnen Arts Centre.

- Tested screen materials using speaker stands and pegs. White stretchy material is the winner.
- Lights: cheap flood is ok when reflected against the wall. Good IR and colour. Infrared LED arrays are very uneven but will do the job if aimed at a a shallow angle and diffused with some tracing paper. Need six in two groups of three to cover the screen. Compact fluorescent lamps have no IR.
- Programming - aiming to extend gesture... spraying pixels. Need tripods for camera and projector.
- Contact microphones work on screen, very low frequency but still useful for triggering.
