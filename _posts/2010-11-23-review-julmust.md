![Julmust testing rig.]({{ site.baseurl }}/squarespace_images/2010-11-23-Julmust.jpg) Julmust testing rig. 

The other day when I went down to ICA to get some food, I saw two girls from Ankars walk in to the shop, each pick up a bottle of Julmust and a block of chocolate and that's it, pay and leave.

So I decided to try this magical meal in a bottle.

As it turns out it's basically cola with fruity and spicy flavors.

The name means Christmas juice and I guess that's why Santa is on the bottle.

Warning! Julmust and chocolate is not a balanced diet!!

Review: it's kind of delicious but smells a bit weird.
