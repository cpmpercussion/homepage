![Julmust testing rig.](/squarespace_images/static_500baf96c4aa540325612fa5_500bb0b2e4b042ea6e35b13f_5019f387e4b0b45850a9102a_1290536336000__img.jpg_) Julmust testing rig. 
  


The other day when I went down to ICA to get some food, I saw two girls from Ankars walk in to the shop, each pick up a bottle of Julmust and a block of chocolate and that's it, pay and leave.


So I decided to try this magical meal in a bottle.


As it turns out it's basically cola with fruity and spicy flavors.


The name means Christmas juice and I guess that's why Santa is on the bottle.


Warning! Julmust and chocolate is not a balanced diet!!


Review: it's kind of delicious but smells a bit weird.
