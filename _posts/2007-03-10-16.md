I played a show this evening in Cooma at the youth centre there. Since two bands pulled out, it was a short show with Los Cap, Strong Like Sam and an interesting metalcore two-piece. When we were about to play Scene Queen, Tim unexpectedly presented me with the microphone. Not one to leave such a challenge stand, I "sang" the whole song through. I even embellished my performance with some of Tim's special brand of hardcore floor squirming.

I'm not entirely sure whether the audience (of 15 kids or so) got the joke.

To make it up to them we played the song again (I didn't sing) really fast. They may not have gotten that joke either...
