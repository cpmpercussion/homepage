My new iOS app, PhaseRings, is out now on the AppStore, just in time for PASIC next week. 
[It's free so go get it!](https://appsto.re/au/ur0h3.i)

PhaseRings has seven sound-schemes and a system for customising generative compositions that let you play with great sounding setups!

If you're heading to PASIC this year, I'm presenting a session on iPads in percussion ensemble on Saturday at 10am, we'll be demonstrating a few new pieces with PhaseRings and my other apps!
