I'm now a [performance teaching fellow at the ANU](http://music.anu.edu.au/people/charles-martin)! I will be specialising in lessons in marimba and vibraphone improvisation as well as helping students to use computer and electronic instruments in their projects. At the ANU and want to have a few lessons with me? Go check out the [Performance Development Allowance page](http://music.anu.edu.au/PDA) and we can make it happen.
