Last Man to Die performed a preview of our upcoming project 
 at Newcastle’s famous This Is Not Art festival. 



Thankyou so much to our audience who attended the two performances at the 
. Especially to those who stood at the back and in the corridor! Also, thanks to David Finnigan and Gillian Schwab, the illustrious managers. This was Crack’s debut year and they made it a seriously cool and happening part of This Is Not Art.
