I met with my new friend [Recotana](http://www.recotana.com/) (Osamu Funada) in Tokyo the other week. We had a coffee, talked about Arduino and iPhone apps, and walked around Akihabara looking at parts shops. His friend Hide was also there to help.Â  I was lucky to have them showing me around, even though I've been to Akihabara a few times he knew the good shops to visit which I'd never seen before.

I only bought a few boring things, some breadboards and an Arduino protoshield, but there is so much specialist electronics available there, it's really overwhelming.
