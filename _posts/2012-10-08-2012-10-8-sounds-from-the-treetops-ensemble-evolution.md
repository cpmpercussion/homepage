Ensemble Evolution's final concert in Sweden was a commissioned performance of six new works for the tree house suites at 
[Treehotel](http://www.treehotel.se), a boutique hotel in Harads, Northern Sweden.


This performance was held in the late evening, under the eerie midnight sun to a select group of the hotel staff, guests and locals and was filmed by August Sandström to become a promotional tool for the hotel.


The final part of this project is a CD of the six works, recorded in Piteå and currently waiting to be mastered before release online and on Spotify and iTunes.


The video above is one of six trailers that August has released for each work, this one features my piece "Mirror" for the Mirror Cube. The other five videos can be found on 
[Ensemble Evolution's website](http://ensemble-evolution.com/more-sounds-from-the-treetops).
