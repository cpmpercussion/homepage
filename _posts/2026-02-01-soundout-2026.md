I had an amazing weekend performing at [SoundOut 2026](https://dhg.anu.edu.au/event_post/soundout-2026/) at the ANU Drill Hall Gallery performing with some incredible Australian and international musicians. SoundOut is described as "one of the gateway exploratory music-art events in Australia" and a gem in Canberra's yearly music schedule.

I was lucky enough to perform wonderful sets with Jesse Twomey, Yichen Wang, Ben Carey, Jamie Lambert, Peter Bruun, Rhys Butler, Phil Durrant, Laura Altman and Nicci Haynes. It was wonderful to perform with these folks including some I hadn't met before and some very old friends!

Especially cool this year to show off two new instruments designed in the ANU SMCClab with Yichen Wang. We have been working hard in the lab to design new ways to build musical instruments involving AI and machine learning technologies.

Huge thanks to Richard Johnson for inviting me to be a part of this SoundOut and congratulations on another amazing festival!
