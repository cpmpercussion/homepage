Ensemble Evolution had a fun concert this weekend at Palmgren Conservatory in Pori, Finland. The highlight for me was our performance of one of my pieces, 
a nice theory, with the percussion students there and Janne Tuomi from the 
Osuma Ensemble. We got a great review in the local paper and Maria took a video of my piece! We have to thank Toni Hietala for setting up the concert and all of his support.

Here’s the video of 
a nice theory.
