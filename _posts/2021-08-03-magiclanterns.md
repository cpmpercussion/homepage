Over the last few years I've been invited to perform at several concerts with Martyn Jolley as part of his [_Heritage in the Limelight_](https://soad.cass.anu.edu.au/research/heritage-limelight) project. Martyn and fellow researcher Elisa deCourcy have been exploring magic lantern slide projection from a historical perspective and for creative re-use.

The "creative re-use" bit is where I have been coming in as a musician along with [Alec Hunter](https://www.alexanderhunter.com.au/). Martyn and Elisa create new magic lantern shows, telling stories or exploring mechanical slides, then Alec and I work with them to create a live soundtrack.

This is one of those projects where the events have been spread out enough for me to **almost** forget how to perform with the magic lanterns in between, but now I look back and see that we've created a significant series of performances.

Martyn and Elisa have a collection of amazing [videos](https://soad.cass.anu.edu.au/research/heritage-limelight/videos) documenting different performances.

Here's a few I worked on:

- J. W. Newland’s "Beautiful Scientific Exhibition of Dissolving Views", PhotoAccess, Canberra. (February 2021) [video](https://vimeo.com/528049825)

- "Suburban Apparitions" - A Magic Lantern Performance at Calthorpe’s House, ACT Historic Places, Canberra (March 2020) [video](https://vimeo.com/405336569)

- Camera Obscura, Ainslie Arts Centre (May 2016)

- "Magic Lantern Horror Show", National Portrait Gallery (February 2016) [video](https://vimeo.com/172507859)

My favourate one is the [latest](https://vimeo.com/528049825) shown in this dramatic video below was shot by Amr Tawfik.
