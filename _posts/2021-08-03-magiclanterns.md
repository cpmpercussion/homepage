Over the last few years I've been invited to perform at several concerts with Martyn Jolley as part of his [_Heritage in the Limelight_](https://soad.cass.anu.edu.au/research/heritage-limelight) project. Martyn and fellow researcher Elisa deCourcy have been exploring magic lantern slide projection from a historical perspective and for creative re-use.

The "creative re-use" bit is where I have been coming in as a musician along with [Alec Hunter](https://www.alexanderhunter.com.au/). Martyn and Elisa create new magic lantern shows, telling stories or exploring mechanical slides, then Alec and I work with them to create a live soundtrack.

This is one of those projects where the events have been spread out enough for me to **almost** forget how to perform with the magic lanterns in between, but now I look back and see that we've created a significant series of performances.

Martyn and Elisa have a collection of amazing [videos](https://soad.cass.anu.edu.au/research/heritage-limelight/videos) documenting different performances.

My favourate one is the [latest that I was involved with](https://vimeo.com/528049825), "J. W. Newlandâ€™s "Beautiful Scientific Exhibition of Dissolving Views" reinterpreted in 2021." The video was shot by Amr Tawfik.
