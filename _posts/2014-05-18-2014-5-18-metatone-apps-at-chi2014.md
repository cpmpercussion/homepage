At the end of April I presented my Metatone Apps at CHI2014 in
Toronto, as well as delivering a short paper. We brought a mini
Ensemble Metatone setup with us: 4 iPads, a passive mixer, splitters,
headphones and a travel WiFi access point. With this little setup, our "customers" could have
impromptu jams on the four iPads and explore the network features of
the apps. It was pretty exhausting to present in the Interactivity
exhibition space at every coffee break and lunchtime while also
attending conference sessions, but we had lots of interested
visitors and discussions about how we use the apps in performance and
the future directions our work could take!


I'm looking forward to implementing some of these ideas and
catching up with some of our new friends at CHI2015!
