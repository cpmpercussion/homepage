I had a brief (one week) trip to Oslo to catch up on ongoing research
projects with colleagues in the engineering predictability with
embodied cognition [(EPEC)](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/projects/all/epec/) project and at the [RITMO Centre](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/).

It was great to get deep into GANs for movement generation with
[Benedikte Wallace](https://www.hf.uio.no/ritmo/english/people/phd-fellows/benediwa/) and computer music teaching issues with [Tejaswinee
Kelkar](http://tejaswinee.com), as well as catch up on old and new papers with [Kai Olav
Ellefsen](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/people/aca/kaiolae/) and [Jim Torresen](https://folk.uio.no/jimtoer/).

I was able to join in on the first week of teaching their master's
project course on machine learning and AI [(IN5490)](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5490/index.html). I gave my intro lecture on
[RNNs for creative sequence learning](https://creativeprediction.xyz/presentations/deep-dive-on-rnns/), and gained a few project students
in collaboration with Benedikte, looking forward some great work
coming out of this!

Here's the talk:
