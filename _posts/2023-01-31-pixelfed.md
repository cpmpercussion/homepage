I've been trying to take photos a bit more intentionally a regularly again,
helped by a new (to me) Fujfilm X-T2 camera. I've ended up posting some images on [pixelfed.au](https://pixelfed.au/charlesmartin) regularly, and hoping to put something quick up most days.

I guess I'm wondering if it's possible to [photoblog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoblog) in 2023 like it's 2008...

In the late 2000s, Flickr was the place to be and little bag photos like [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/superlocal/304190507/) sucked me in. Flickr was often about discovery as much as following people, I somehow felt part of a community there even if I wans't a terribly active participant. I guess Instagram killed my interest in Flickr, but that has just become a doomscrolling timesuck with little interesting discovery.

I guess I could host images here on this site, and I have in the past. Most of the photo posts here were actually imports from [Posterous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterous) where the defining feature was emailing a bunch of images to create a gallery post. Given the interest in the fediverse, I'll see if Pixelfed works. I've been using the [iOS app](https://mastodon.social/@pixelfed/109133606987470446) which is currently available in an open beta. The app is definitely still a bit buggy, but feels small and calm compared to the big socials.
