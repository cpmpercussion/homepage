Achievement for the day was to gather the necessary items for cooking dinner and having a bathroom. Headed down to one of two big supermarkets in town, I chose the one called "Coop" rather than "ICA", which is about 30 minutes walk. Had to limit myself to absolute necessities since I had to carry it all home! 



I bought:

1 bathroom mat

1 shower curtain

8 AA batteries

1 electric jug

microfiber cleaning cloths

self soaping dishwashing sponge thing

Nice teabags

Nice instant coffee

Pasta

2 x instant noodles

nice pasta sauce

beef mince (I think it's beef?)

frozen vegetables

salt

biscuits

gladwrap

shampoo

laundry powder

tissues



and some other stuff I can't remember.



Then, since I had all the ikea cooking stuff, I should be able to make dinner right?



Wrong.



Since I'm in sweden you have to make dinner the Ikea way, i.e. Step 1 is "Build your saucepans", so I had to build and wash all the saucepans etc (see photos).



Luckily the Ikea kit came with a colander and a big pasta spoon thing otherwise I would have been in 
.



Anyway, dinner was successful.



Wondering what other stuff I need? Probably some more varied food, and fruit, etc, but I like keeping it simple. There's waay more room in the fridge than in the rest of the kitchen and there's particularly heaps of room in the freezer, so I can keep lots of frozen stuff on hand. 



Is a microwave necessary? Particularly for defrosting meat, cooking frozen vegetables, reheating yesterday's food? I wonder how much one is. I think they have them at Coop as well.



Next thing I really need are:

Proper sheets -- as much as I love my (Christina's) sleeping bag sheet, I should probably buy regular ones that are easier to wash. Coop has them, but I don't know the words for different sheet forms (i.e. pillow, fitted, regular..) and it was too hard last night to work it out.



Dustpan and brush - Coop didn't seem to have them

Microfibre mop thing - my whole flat has a lino floor which is still dirty. I made a valient attempt with one of my microfibre cloths, but a mop thing would be waay easier. Need the dustpan first.
