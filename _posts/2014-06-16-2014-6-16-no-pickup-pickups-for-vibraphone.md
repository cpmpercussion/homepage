A few years ago I was really interested in finding ways to augment the vibraphone with computer music sounds, particularly ways that could fit in my backpack since I was travelling a lot and using other people's vibes!

I wrote [this post](http://charlesmartin.com.au/blog/2011/10/28/a-computer-music-system-for-vibraphone.html) about an array of small mics and a preamp that I made myself to use with the RjDj app on my iPhone (also my [master's thesis](http://pure.ltu.se/portal/en/studentthesis/mobile-computer-music-for-percussionists(180ad458-3f35-49eb-b483-8245469b0403).html)). It worked pretty well for the time, but soon after I put it together lots of iPhone music accessories came out that made my home-made monstrosity obsolete. So here's my modern "no-pickup" setup:

What's in my bag.. for a vibraphone and computer music gig. 

## Mobile Computer Music setup for Vibraphone:

* Microphone: [Behringer C-2](http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/C-2.aspx). This mic sucks and is part of a pair, but I don't mind leaving it around in my bag and it's small and light so it works for this setup. Any other condenser mic would work fine, most would work better.
* Velcro cable ties: I use these to attach everything to the vibraphone securely without marking the frame. I put a bunch of sticky-backed velcro on the mic clip so that I can attach it somewhere underneath the bars.
* Microphone Cable: I have a short mic cable that doesn't weigh me down or get tangled.
* Preamp: [IK Multimedia iRig Pre](http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigpre/), one side is an iPhone headphone plug, other side is a mic input. 9V battery, seems to work. I think there's a new version that uses the Lightning connector..
* To the PA system: I always bring a 3.5mm stereo jack to 2x 6.5mm mono jack lead and a DI so that I can plug into any PA system. Sound guys never have enough DIs. Never. The [Behringer DI20](http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/DI20.aspx) is cheap and light and stereo, works for me.
* Phone: iPhone 5 with an [OtterBox Reflex case](http://www.otterbox.com/iPhone-5/5S-Reflex-Series-Case/apl7-new-iphone-5,default,pd.html) - I just leave it on the vibraphone rail. Haven't hit it with a mallet... yet?
* Apps: I usually use my [Nordlig Vinter app](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/nordlig-vinter/id631988721?mt=8) which has effects and background sounds for my [own pieces](http://charlesmartin.com.au/nordlig-vinter/), [IK Multimedia's Vocalive app](http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/vocalive/) could be fun for trying out different effects.

(BTW, this setup really only works on a quiet stage, not in a loud band situation.)
