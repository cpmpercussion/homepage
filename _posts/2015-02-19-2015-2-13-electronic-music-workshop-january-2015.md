In January 2015 I ran a four day workshop  in computer music, hardware hacking and new interfaces at the ANU School of Music.


The seven participants learned the basics of electronics assembly, computer music with Pure Data and Arduino programming over four days giving them a suite of skills to draw on for their future projects!


In second half of the workshop, the students were challenged by Alec Hunter to compose an ensemble work to be performed at a finale performance night and we ended up with seven great new works! Here's some images from the event and the performance night, and videos from the ANU School of Music's YouTube Channel.


The workshop was really successful and I'm looking forward to running more events like this!

I also had the chance to play back the whole concert set on the Subsequence Radio show on Canberra's 2XX radio.
