In May 2014, while I was travelling through Boston, I had the chance to embark on a mini-tour with Maria Finkelmeier as part of 
[ArtWeek Boston](http://www.artweekboston.org), in between our mallet duo and iPad concerts, we played two nights of experimental music for ice and percussion at the 
[Frost Bar](http://www.frosticebar.com) called 
Frost Beat!


Along with glass artist 
[Sarah Cohen](http://www.sarahlovesglass.com), Maria froze up a percussion section of glass chimes, bars and blocks for us to perform on, I brought along some computer music know how and we performed sets of improvised music for the fascinated customers!


Here's some great images courtesy of Mark Landsberg and a video Maria put together of our concerts!
 
   

 

Since this concert, Maria has put together 
[ANOTHER 
Frost Beat night](http://www.mariafinkelmeier.com/news/2014/9/26/frostbeat-20) with Amy Garapic. Hopefully I'll get to come back sometime and make some more ice music!
