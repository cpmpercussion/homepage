Last week the Last Mans and I put on a little run of our [show](http://lastmantodie.net/) as part of [National Science Week](http://www.scienceweek.gov.au/).

Most exciting for me was the chance to refine the wearable interface I put together for Hanna.

I upgraded from a regular arduino, xbee shield and 6 AA batteries to an [Arduino Fio](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardFio) and a LiPo battery. The Arduino Fio is super cool to use, it has a built-in xBee socket, and a charging circuit for the lithium polymer battery. The old rig used to be strapped on to Hannaâ€™s back but we could stick the new setup to her arm with velcro so it was much easier to take on and off.

Now what else can I do with the Fio?
