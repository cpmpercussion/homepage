We recently had the chance to present some experimental musical instruments developed as part of the EPEC project at Oslo Konserthus as part of their "Score" video game music concert.

We brought along a set of rapidly-prototyped handmade synthesisers, my iPad musical instrument PhaseRings and some new experimental music apps for Android and iOS.

Lots of great interest and conversation from concertgoers young and old as well as a few quizzical looks about our "weird sounds"!
