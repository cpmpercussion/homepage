!!

 Today Lisa received our new infrared LED lights and we set them up on the rack we had already made. 
 Even without working on aiming and calibrating them too much they already work pretty well!! Much better shadows than with the halogen work lights. 
 Plus! We got our PS3 camera cases and lenses from peau productions!
