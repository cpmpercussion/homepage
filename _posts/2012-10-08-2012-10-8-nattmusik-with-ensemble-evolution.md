In June 2012, 
Ensemble Evolution put together a "farewell" tour in Northern Sweden to celebrate everything the area had given to us and enjoy the midnight sun and amazing natural environment.


We performed concerts at Storforsen Hotel's Chapel, Piteå Badhusparken, Luleå's "Lillan" Theatre and the iconic 
[Treehotel](http://www.treehotel.se) at Harads. 
Ensemble Evolution was joined by clarinetist, Angela Occhionero, an old friend of Maria's from the US and our longtime collaborator, Anna K. Larson (interactive vocalist). Together we performed repertoire that we had put together over our two years in residence in Piteå and new works commissioned by Treehotel for each of their tree house suites.


Two of my favourite performances are embedded here, Jacob and myself playing one of my tunes "Footprints in Snow" at Storforsen above and 
Ensemble Evolution playing our "Solstormen" suite at Badhusparken below.
 
   

 

Every performance was recorded, so there's too much material to post it all here, but everything is on youtube in 
[this playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnRoOVbpGXfZaRKZACoUu-uJFDnXCo9Qa&feature=addto), which is embedded here!
