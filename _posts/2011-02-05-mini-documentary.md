Here's a mini-documentary of [Strike on Stage](http://strikeonstage.posterous.com), a percussion and media-art project that I worked on with [Chi-Hsia Lai](http://laichisia.com) in 2010.

This was one of my favourite technology projects, we went for a crazy idea, had a lot of fun figuring out new ways to setup lights, screens, cameras, instruments and computers and had great performances.

Luckily I commissioned my friend Pete Butz to document the main performances as well as an interview with Chi-Hsia at I and a rehearsal and to put together this video. It really shows how our system works and what we did in the performances.
