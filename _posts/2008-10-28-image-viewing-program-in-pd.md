I created a program in Pd that displays a set of jpeg images. You can flick through the images using MIDI notes, a sustain or expression pedal (just a MIDI CC#) or by producing a percussive sound into a microphone (attack detection using [bonk~]).

The idea of the program is to display a musical score full screen and allow me to turn pages with a pedal, but it also works with lolcats. Lol!

I've already used the program in performances and installations. It's a bit rough, but it does the job!

There are notes about the program and a high resolution view [on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chuck_notorious/2979386957/).
