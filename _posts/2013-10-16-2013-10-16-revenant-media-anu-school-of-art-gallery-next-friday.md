**Update!**
 Videos and photos from the event are in

I'm performing with Ensemble Metatone at a very exciting concert on Friday 25/10 at the ANU School of Art Gallery!


Revenant Media is a special event celebrating a pioneering piece of new-media artwork: Stanslaus Ostoja-Kotkowski's 
Theremin '75.


Four theremins have been reconstructed from the event from original and new parts and Ensemble Metatone and I will use them to perform Prof. Larry Sitsky's work 
The Legions of Asmodeus commissioned for the ANU's "Computer and Electronics in the Arts" in 1975.


Following the 
Legion, the Metatones and I will perform our iPad work 
MetaLonsdale and Ben Swift will perform a new work for live-coded audiovisuals.


There's going to be music and video at the gallery from 6pm-9pm - and it's free. Be there!

Look out for more photos and videos as the theremins are assembled over the next week!
