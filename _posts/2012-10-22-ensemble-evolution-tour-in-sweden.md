In May 2011, [Ensemble Evolution](http://ensemble-evolution.com) went on tour into the south of Sweden to play concerts and give workshops at Oscarshamn Folkhögskolan, Västerviks Museum and in Stockholm.

Despite our insistence that it was "spring", there was a horrible blizzard while we were in Oscarshamn, just when we wanted to move all the equipment!

The tour was great, we met a lot of great students, teachers and locals and experienced another side of Sweden! I had a chance to play a few duos with Anders which the start of a new thing for me!
