In August 2013, Ensemble Metatone and I performed a short concert of our works for iPad and percussion developed over the previous four months. We played two improvised pieces, MetaLonsdale for four iPads, and MetaTravels for four iPads with percussion.

The concert was held in the ANU School of Music's Band Room and we were able do a multitracked recording of the audio and video as well as capturing touch data from the iPads. The resulting animations and video give a unique point of view of the performance.

The concert was also an important chance for us to engage with a knowledgeable audience and discuss the issues involved in using touch instruments in live performance.

The video of both works is embedded below! Hope you enjoy them!
