  summary: |
    The Intelligent Musical Prediction System (IMPS) is a system for connecting musicians and interface developers with deep neural networks. 
    IMPS connects with any musical interface or software using open sound control (OSC) and helps users to record a dataset, 
    train a neural network and interact with it in real-time performance.

  summary: |
    This project was to develop a physically encapsulated musical neural network. 
    The box contains a Raspberry running a melody-generating recurrent neural network that continually composes music. 
    You can adjust the sound, tempo, the ML-model used, and the "randomness" of the chosen samples to guide the music making process.

  summary: |
    PhaseRings is a touchscreen instrument that works with an ML-connected ensemble. 
    A server tracks the four performer's improvisations and adjusts their user interface during the performance 
    to give them access to different summarys and sounds on their screens.

  summary: |
    This installation of six self-playing, sensor-driven guitars was developed as part of collaborations at the University of 
    Oslo's RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion. 
    Each guitar uses a [Bela](https://bela.io) embedded computer to generate sounds from a speaker driver attached to the guitar body. 
    A distance sensor track the movement of listeners in the environment and the guitars use a 
    firefly synchronisation algorithm to phase in and out of time.

  summary: |
    The EMPI is a minimal electronic musical instrument for experimenting
    with predictive interaction techniques. It includes a single physical
    input (a lever) and a matching physical output, built-in speaker, and
    a Raspberry Pi for sound synthesis and ML computations.
