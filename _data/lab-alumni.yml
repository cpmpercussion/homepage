    Feiyue created a VR system for experimenting with web interfaces in a work environment and was awarded a [Postgraduate Medal for Academic Excellence](https://cecc.anu.edu.au/news/gamble-pays-computing-standout-lands-google) in her Master of Computing (Advanced) program. 
    During her program, Feiyue was a research trainee at CSIRO Data61 and she was recruited by Google soon after graduation.
  abstract: The emergence of augmented reality (AR) is reshaping how people can observe and interact with their physical world and digital content. Virtual instructions provided by see-through AR can greatly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of physical tasks, but the cost of content authoring in previous research calls for more utilization of legacy information in AR. Web information is a great source hosting a wide range of legacy and instructional resources, yet current web browsing experience in AR headsets has not exploited the advantage of 3D immersive space mixing the real and virtual environments. Instead of creating new AR content or transforming from legacy resources, this research investigates how to better present web interfaces in AR headsets, especially in a physical task instruction context. A new approach multi-view AR web interfaces is proposed, which suggests separating web components into multiple panels that can be freely arranged in the user's surrounding 3D space. The separation and arrangement would allow more flexible combination of web content from multiple sources and with other AR applications in the user's field of view.

    Auditory information provides great help to human beings to recognize their surroundings and positions. However, the sound we perceived in the environment is often a mixture of many sounds that happened at the same time. Therefore, developing a system to automatically extract information from unprocessed audio provides a huge potential for human beings. For example, it can be utilized by automatic diving, multimedia searching, robots, etc. In this study, we proposed two Attention-based Neural Network models to achieve automatic acoustic scene classification systems. Both two models are powerful in extracting information on audio spectrograms and classifying them into their corresponding scene labels. We applied two acoustic scene datasets to verify our model and got the best accuracies which are 15.7% and 8.0% higher than their CNN baselines.

    Composing and playing music generally requires knowledge of music theory and exercise in instrument training. While traditional musical instruments often require years of arduous practice to master, intelligent musical systems can provide an easier introduction into music creation for novice users. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a novel intelligent instrument for interactive generation of music with recurrent neural networks, allowing users with little to no musical experience to explore musical ideas.

  project-title: Variational Autoencoders with Mixture Density Networks for Sequence Prediction in Algorithmic Composition - A Musical World Model
  thesis-url: http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-70656
  thesis-doi:

  abstract: |
    Does music contain a hierarchical component which is relevant when teaching a machine learning model to create music? And, can a machine learning model learn long term structure in music, based on its own perception of data?
    The Mixture Density Network, a network that can predict multi-valued output, was developed in 1994 by Christopher M. Bishop. The model can utilize any kind of network to condition the probability distributions. In 2018, David Ha and Ju ̈rgen Schmidhuber used a recurrent mixture density network (MDRNN) for predicting latent vectors in a reinforcement learning model. This has inspired the idea of replacing the recurrent composer from the MusicVAE with a MDRNN. This thesis introduces this novel architecture, in which musical compositions are guided by generating sequences of vectors from a VAE’s compressed latent space. This is a novel architecture, in which compositions of music is guided by learned sequences of latent vectors. The model is named Mixture Composer Variational Autoencoder, or MCVAE.
    Evaluation of the models showed that a difference in the models was noticeable. An evaluation with human annotators shows that music that has been composed by the MCVAE has noticeably better musical qualities than music generated from the formal VAE. Another evaluation, using a 5-gram model show that music made with guidance from the MDN creates melodies which are a lot more probable than music made without guidance.

  project-title: Predictive songwriting with concatenative accompaniment
  thesis-url: http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-65381
  thesis-doi:
  dates: 2016-2018

  abstract: |
    Musicians often use tools such as loop-pedals and multitrack recorders to assist in improvisation and songwriting. While these devices are useful in creating new compositions from scratch, they do not contribute to the composition directly. In recent years, new musical instruments, interfaces and controllers using machine learning algorithms to create new sounds, generate accompaniment or construct novel compositions, have become available for both professional musicians and novices to enjoy. This thesis describes the design, implementation and evaluation of a system for predictive songwriting and improvisation using concatenative accompaniment which has been given the nickname PSCA. In its most simple form, the PSCA functions as an audio looper for vocal improvisation, but the system also utilises machine learning approaches to predict suitable harmonies to accompany the playback loop. Two machine learning algorithms were compared and implemented into the PSCA to facilitate harmony prediction: the hidden Markov model (HMM) and the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM). The HMM and BLSTM algorithms are trained on a dataset of lead sheets in order to learn the relationship between the notes in a melody and the chord which accompanies it as well as learning dependencies between chords to model chord progressions. In quantitative testing, the BLSTM model was found to be able to learn the harmony prediction task more effectively than the HMM model, this was also supported by a qualitative analysis of musicians using the PSCA system. The system proposed in this thesis provides a novel approach in which these two machine learning models are compared with regards to prediction accuracy on the dataset as well as the perceived musicality of each model when used for harmony prediction in the PSCA. This approach results in a system which can contribute to the improvisation and songwriting process by adding harmonies to the audio loop on-the-fly.

  thesis-doi:
  dates: 2016-2018

  abstract: |
    In this thesis I explore three different techniques for generating digital audio using neural networks. All three techniques use different network structures and architectures suitable for generating sequential data. Operating at the sample level requires each technique to model dependencies across large time lags in order to generate realistic audio. This is a hard task for even the most sophisticated techniques.
    To gain an understanding of how each technique works I have implemented two neural networks of different structures based on the same architecture, as well as familiarized myself with an implementation of a network using an architecture not commonly used to model sequential data.
    To compare each technique I have trained each model on a dataset containing a large number of classical piano pieces. Each model is evaluated in terms of the audio quality and musicality of their generated audio.
    Results suggest that each model could be used in applications using short amounts of digital audio. It is unclear, however, if these techniques are able to generate arbitrary music with high level structures, while containing the small details necessary to generate realistic sounds.
