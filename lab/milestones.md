title: PhD Milestone Expectations in SMCC
permalink: /lab/milestones/
---

Here's some information for PhD/MPhil studens in the Sound, Music and Creative Computing lab for what is expected for degree milestones.

The ANU has little information about how to complete milestone, the following information has been developed by looking at a variety of ANU documents and conversations with colleagues at the School of Computing.

## Annual Reports


## Thesis Proposal Review

The "Thesis Proposal Review" is the first major milestone for a PhD student and
should be completed between 9-12 months into their program (or a little after
that depending on practicalities). This submission should reflect on research
completed in the early stages of their program and propose a realistic plan for
the completion of the rest of their program. At this point, the candidate will
probably have two existing "research proposals", one written as part of their
PhD application and their "first annual plan" completed 3 months into their
program. In contrast, the TPR is a more **realistic proposal** supported by
evidence, that is, reviewed literature and early research work that may still
be in progress.

Let's look at how a TPR is described by others and then I'll introduce some guidelines for our lab.

ANU [TPR Bootcamp](https://services.anu.edu.au/training/thesis-proposal-review-boot-camp) text:

> The TPR should set out a clear research problem, situate your research
> proposal in the literature and tell the audience how you plan to carry out
> the research. 

ANU [Research Candidates Milestones](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/research-candidate-milestones):

> The Thesis Proposal Review (TPR) is a detailed thesis proposal, literature
> review, report on research activities since commencement, and plan for the
> next year. The review indicates the subject of your proposed research, the
> methodology to be employed (including proposed fieldwork, if applicable), an
> analysis of relevant literature, and a description of how your research will
> contribute to the field of study. The TPR is an excellent opportunity to get
> detailed feedback from your supervisory panel on your progress, as well as
> comprehensive advice on the appropriateness and feasibility of your research
> plans. Your College, School or Centre will have more information about the
> format of your TPR.

> All members of the supervisory panel participate in a TPR, and the Chair of
> the Supervisory panel should include comments made during the meeting, and
> make a recommendation on progress in the eForm. The Delegated Authority
> approves and determines the outcome of the milestone.

[College of Engineering, Computing and Cybernetics guidelines](https://cecc.anu.edu.au/sites/default/files/u10816/cecs_hdr_milestone_guidelines_2018.pdf) (2018):

> The Thesis Proposal Review (TPR) is a detailed thesis proposal that describes
> the student’s proposed research for the HDR program. The TPR serves as an
> excellent opportunity for the student to gain comprehensive feedback from the
> supervisory panel on the research progress, as well as insightful advice on
> the appropriateness and feasibility of the research plans.

> The recommended length of the TPR document is 5 to 10 pages, while a longer
> document is also acceptable if it is required by the student’s supervisory
> panel. All members of the student’s supervisory panel are expected to attend
> the TPR review and/or presentation. The TPR would be a comprehensive document
> to allow the student’s supervisory panel and the HDR Delegated Authority
> and/or Convener to assess whether the student has a deep and well-rounded
> understanding of the research of interest, as well as a clearly organised and
> well-thought-out plan for completion.

Of the above, the TPR bootcamp description is concise and clear and is a good model for our local requirements.

The ANU and CECC guidelines show that all members of your panel need to provide feedback on your TPR and it is a chance for the panel to be fully briefed on your research plan.

### SMCClab requirements

So given the above, for your TPR you should prepare a document and (optionally) a presentation. Here's what we expect in the SMCClab:

#### Document

- 5--10 pages
- PDF produced in Latex with _excellent_ formatting and referencing (APA author-date style referencing preferred)
- Follow a standard structure: introduction, related work, proposed (and completed) methodology, research results to date, discussion of findings so far and expectations for future studies
- You don't need to repeat the content of existing manuscripts (just refer to them)
- Your TPR document should provide a clear and persuasive description of your research problem and how you intend to address it. 
- Your plan should be backed by evidence from the literature and your research so far.
- The future work plan should propose specific research projects that will likely be associated with an important publication.

You should plan to have your TPR document completed at least one week before you "submit" it in the eForm system so that (at least) I have a chance to provide feedback on it before it is submitted.

#### Seminar

A seminar or presentation of your TPR is _not required_ by ANU policies. That said, many groups in the School of Computing expect students at the TPR level to do a public presentation as part of the TPR assessment.

The seminar would normally be:

- 45 minutes with 15 minutes for questions
- scheduled to take place in a public seminar room (e.g., CSIT Room N101, Hanna Neumann building Board Room)
- be advertised on the School / Cluster mailing lists
- be structured similarly to your TPR document but with more focus on justifying your research problem, your work so far and (briefly) what you plan to do next (nobody wants to hear a literature review being read out loud)

Your seminar should take place at least one week **after** your TPR document has been submitted officially (so that all supervisors have a chance to read the written version of your TPR).

### Hints for your TPR process

- talk to other PhD students / recent grads about their TPR experience to gauge the expectations
- attend the ANU TPR bootcamp _if you want_ for inspiration, but not direction as all ANU schools have different requirements and some expect a very long TPR (e.g., 50 pages)
- some folks view the TPR as "box ticking" and not to be taken seriously, this is not the approach within my lab, I expect a real effort to level up your articulation of your research plan which is hard work regardless of the length of document
- the TPR is one of the few opportunities for supervisors to officially provide negative feedback with consequences, if you don't engage with the process properly and seek early feedback you may be asked to redo/resubmit your TPR document
