	Abstract = {Nordlig Vinter is a flexible length work for vibraphone and iOS devices. The work recalls the my first experiences of the icy winter in Pite{\aa}, Northern Sweden and was composed while in residency at the School of Music there. The work includes sections of composed material in a minimal jazz style where themes on the vibraphone are presented in the context of computer-generated sounds constructed from field recordings taken in Pite{\aa}. These sections are contrasted by elements of free improvisation where the vibraphone part goes into musical dialogue with the computer elements that effect and react to the vibraphone sound.},

	Abstract = {This thesis seeks to articulate a performer's
                  perspective of the interactions between percussion
                  and computer in performance. A selection of
                  compositions for percussion and computer will be
                  used to explain how understanding the role of the
                  computer can inform the player's technical and
                  musical choices and is vital to convey a cohesive
                  performance. Two of the compositions are the
                  author's own work. Discussion of both the creation
                  and performance of these works will suggest how
                  using the computer with percussion extends the
                  musical possibilities in a solo performance and
                  allows implicit connections with practitioners of
                  other art-forms.},

                  developed and performed in 2010 by percussionists
                  and media artists Chi-Hsia Lai and Charles Martin.
                  The concept of Strike on Stage is to integrate
                  computer visuals and sound into an improvised
                  percussion performance. A large projection surface
                  is positioned directly behind the performers, while
                  a computer vision system tracks their movements. The
                  setup allows computer visualisation and sonification
                  to be directly responsive and unified with the
                  performers' gestures.},

	Abstract = {This thesis traces the development of a number of
                  mobile computer music systems and their use in
                  ensemble percussion performances. The research is
                  motivated by the challenges of working with laptop
                  based computer music systems in ensemble situations.
                  The aims were to develop elegant, portable, and
                  flexible computer music tools, to make these tools
                  accessible to other percussionists, and to discover
                  the opportunities that they enable in performance
                  practice. These aims have been explored through
                  three musical projects for percussion and Apple's
                  iOS devices: Nordlig Vinter, a suite of duo
                  compositions; and two collaborative works, 3p3p and
                  Snow Music developed together with two other
                  percussionists. Articulated from a performer's
                  perspective, this artistic research examines a
                  number of software frameworks for developing mobile
                  computer music applications. The development,
                  rehearsal process and performances of the musical
                  projects have been documented with video and audio
                  recordings. An ethnographic investigation of this
                  data has given insight into the limitations and
                  affordances of mobile computer music devices in a
                  variety of performance contexts. All of the projects
                  implemented elegant computer music setups and the
                  limited visual interfaces of the mobile devices
                  demanded simple but clear interface design. In Snow
                  Music in particular, "percussive" interaction with
                  the mobile devices along with an improvised
                  performance practice contributed to a collaborative
                  development cycle. This process revealed some of the
                  limits of expression with the computer sounds used
                  and led to a very successful series of performance
                  outcomes.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a series of musical works
                  designed to integrate mobile computer instruments
                  into a percussion ensemble performance practice. The
                  works were motivated by the author's desire to
                  introduce computer music elements to non-programmer
                  members of the percussion group Ensemble Evolution.
                  Each of the works used simple setups with Apple iOS
                  devices in order to facilitate rehearsals and
                  increase the performers' engagement with the
                  computer elements of the works. This artistic
                  research considers the performance practices that
                  are enabled and demanded when complementing acoustic
                  percussion instruments with mobile music devices.
                  The first two works, 3p3p and Nordlig Vinter used
                  computer music elements composed in Pure Data
                  running on iPhones using RjDj in the context of
                  semi-composed works for percussion. The third work,
                  Snow Music was a collaboratively developed
                  improvised work using percussion and a native iOS
                  app developed with libpd. An ethnographic analysis
                  of the preparation and performance of the three
                  works shows a development in the role of mobile
                  devices in the performances and the emergence of
                  performance practices using both natural
                  interactions and control of generative processes. },

                  performance information across networked
                  iPad-instruments to enable creativity among an

@phdthesis{Martin:2016nr,
	Abstract = {This thesis concerns the making and performing of music with new digital musical instruments (DMIs) designed for ensemble performance. While computer music has advanced to the point where a huge variety of digital instruments are common in educational, recreational, and professional music-making, these instruments rarely seek to enhance the ensemble context in which they are used. Interaction models that map individual gestures to sound have been previously studied, but the interactions of ensembles within these models are not well understood. In this research, new ensemble-focussed instruments have been designed and deployed in an ongoing artistic practice. These instruments have also been evaluated to find out whether, and if so how, they affect the ensembles and music that is made with them. Throughout this thesis, six ensemble-focussed DMIs are introduced for mobile touch-screen computers. A series of improvised rehearsals and performances leads to the identification of a vocabulary of continuous performative touch-gestures and a system for tracking these collaborative performances in real time using tools from machine learning. The tracking system is posed as an intelligent agent that can continually analyse the gestural states of performers, and trigger a response in the performers' user interfaces at appropriate moments. The hypothesis is that the agent interaction and UI response can enhance improvised performances, allowing performers to better explore creative interactions with each other, produce better music, and have a more enjoyable experience. Two formal studies are described where participants rate their perceptions of improvised performances with a variety of designs for agent-app interaction. The first, with three expert performers, informed refinements for a set of apps. The most successful interface was redesigned and investigated further in a second study with 16 non-expert participants. In the final interface, each performer freely improvised with a limited number of notes; at moments of peak gestural change, the agent presented users with the opportunity to try different notes. This interface is shown to produce performances that are longer, as well as demonstrate improved perceptions of musical structure, group interaction, enjoyment and overall quality. Overall, this research examined ensemble DMI performance in unprecedented scope and detail, with more than 150 interaction sessions recorded. Informed by the results of lab and field studies using quantitative and qualitative methods, four generations of ensemble-focussed interface have been developed and refined. The results of the most recent studies assure us that the intelligent agent interaction does enhance improvised performances.},

MicroJam includes several novel performance concepts intended to engage the casual music maker and inspired by current trends in social creativity support tools. Touch-screen performances are limited to five seconds, instrument settings are posed as sonic ``filters'', and past performances are arranged as a timeline with replies and layers. These features of MicroJam encourage users not only to perform music more frequently, but to engage with others in impromptu ensemble music making.},

	Abstract = {For many, the pursuit and enjoyment of musical performance goes hand-in-hand with collaborative creativity, whether in a choir, jazz combo, orchestra, or rock band. However, few musical interfaces use the affordances of computers to create or enhance ensemble musical experiences. One possibility for such a system would be to use an artificial neural network (ANN) to model the way other musicians respond to a single performer. Some forms of music have well-understood rules for interaction; however, this is not the case for free improvisation with new touch-screen instruments where styles of interaction may be discovered in each new performance. This paper describes an ANN model of ensemble interactions trained on a corpus of such ensemble touch-screen improvisations. The results show realistic ensemble interactions and the model has been used to implement a live performance system where a performer is accompanied by the predicted and sonified touch gestures of three virtual players.},
